EDITOR'S NOTE
</p>

<p>
In these volumes the word <i>adventure</i> has been
used in its broadest sense to cover not only strange
happenings in strange places but also love and life
and death&mdash;all things that have to do with the great
adventure of living.  Questions as to the fitness of a
story were settled by examining the qualities of the
narrative as such, rather than by reference to a
technical classification of short stories.
</p>

<p>
It is the inalienable right of the editor of a work
of this kind to plead copyright difficulties in
extenuation for whatever faults it may possess.  We beg the
reader to believe that this is why his favorite story
was omitted while one vastly inferior was included.

<p>
The Emperor Yuentsoong, of the dynasty
Chow, was the most magnificent of the
long-descended succession of Chinese sovereigns.
On his first accession to the throne, his character
was so little understood that a conspiracy was set on
foot among the yellow-caps, or eunuchs, to put out
his eyes, and place upon the throne the rebel,
Szema, in whose warlike hands, they asserted, the
empire would more properly maintain its ancient
glory.  The gravity and reserve which these myrmidons
of the palace had construed into stupidity and
fear, soon assumed another complexion, however.
The eunuchs silently disappeared; the mandarins
and princes whom they had seduced from their
allegiance, were made loyal subjects by a generous
pardon; and in a few days after the period fixed
upon for the consummation of the plot, Yuentsoong
set forth in complete armour at the head of his
troops to give battle to the rebel in the mountains.
</p>

<p>
In Chinese annals this first enterprise of the
youthful Yuentsoong is recorded with great pomp
and particularity.  Szema was a Tartar prince of
uncommon ability, young like the emperor, and,
during the few last imbecile years of the old sovereign,
he had gathered strength in his rebellion, till
now he was at the head of ninety thousand men, all
soldiers of repute and tried valour.
</p>

<p>
The historian goes on to record that Yuentsoong
was victorious, and returned to the capital with the
formidable enemy, whose life he had spared, riding
beside him like a brother.  The conqueror's career,
for several years after this, seems to have been a
series of exploits of personal valour, and the Tartar
prince shared in all his dangers and pleasures, his
inseparable friend.  It was during this period of
romantic friendship that one of the events occurred
which have made Yuentsoong one of the idols of
Chinese poetry.
</p>

<p>
By the side of a lake in a distant province of the
empire, stood one of the imperial palaces of pleasure,
seldom visited, and almost in ruins.  Hither in one
of his moody periods of repose from war, came the
conqueror Yuentsoong, for the first time in years
separated from his faithful Szema.  In disguise,
and with only one or two attendants, he established
himself in the long, silent halls of his ancestor
Tsinchemong, and with his boat upon the lake and his
spear in the forest, seemed to find all the amusement
of which his melancholy was susceptible.  On a
certain day in the latter part of April, the emperor
had set his sail to a fragrant south wind, and
reclining on the cushions of his bark, watched the shore
as it softly and silently glided past, and the lake
being entirely encircled by the imperial forest, he
felt immersed in what he believed to be the solitude
of a deserted paradise.  After skirting the fringed
sheet of water in this manner for several hours, he
suddenly observed that he had shot through a streak
of peach-blossoms floating from the shore, and at
the same moment he became conscious that his
boat was slightly headed off by a current setting
outward.  Putting up his helm, he returned to the
spot, and beneath the drooping branches of some
luxuriant willows, thus early in leaf, he discovered
the mouth of an inlet, which, but for the floating
blossoms it brought to the lake, would have escaped
the notice of the closest observer.  The emperor
now lowered his sail, unshipped the slender mast,
and betook him to the oars, and as the current was
gentle, and the inlet wider within the mouth, he
sped rapidly on, through what appeared to be but
a lovely and luxuriant vale of the forest.  Still,
those blushing betrayers of some flowering spot
beyond extended like a rosy clue before him, and
with impulse of muscles swelled and indurated in
warlike exercise, the swift keel divided the besprent
mirror winding temptingly onward, and, for a long
hour, the royal oarsman untiringly threaded this
sweet vein of the wilderness.
</p>

<p>
Resting a moment on his oars while the slender
bark still kept her way, he turned his head toward
what seemed to be an opening in the forest on the
left, and in the same instant the boat ran, head on, to
the shore, the inlet at this point almost doubling
on its course.  Beyond, by the humming of bees
and the singing of birds, there should be a spot more
open than the tangled wilderness he had passed,
and disengaging his prow from the alders, he shoved
the boat again into the stream, and pulled round a
high rock, by which the inlet seemed to have been
compelled to curve its channel.  The edge of a
bright green meadow now stole into the perspective,
and still widening with his approach, disclosed a
slightly rising terrace clustered with shrubs, and
studded here and there with vases; and farther on,
upon the same side of the stream, a skirting edge of
peach-trees loaded with the gay blossoms which had
guided him hither.
</p>

<p>
Astonished at the signs of habitation in what was
well understood to be a privileged wilderness,
Yuentsoong kept his boat in mid-stream, and with
his eyes vigilantly on the alert, slowly made
headway against the current.  A few strokes with his
oars, however, traced another curve of the inlet,
and brought into view a grove of ancient trees
scattered over a gently ascending lawn, beyond
which, hidden from the river till now by the
projecting shoulder of a mound, lay a small pavilion
with gilded pillars, glittering like fairy work in the
sun.  The emperor fastened his boat to a tree
leaning over the water, and with his short spear in
his hand, bounded upon the shore, and took his
way toward the shining structure, his heart beating
with a feeling of interest and wonder altogether
new.  On a nearer approach, the bases of the pillars
seemed decayed by time and the gilding weather-stained
and tarnished, but the trellised porticoes
on the southern aspect were laden with flowering
shrubs, in vases of porcelain, and caged birds
sang between the pointed arches, and there were
manifest signs of luxurious taste, elegance, and
care.
</p>

<p>
A moment, with an indefinable timidity, the
emperor paused before stepping from the green
sward upon the marble floor of the pavilion, and in
that moment a curtain was withdrawn from the
door, and a female, with step suddenly arrested
by the sight of the stranger, stood motionless before
him.  Ravished with her extraordinary beauty,
and awe-struck with the suddenness of the apparition
and the novelty of the adventure, the emperor's
tongue cleaved to his mouth, and ere he could
summon resolution, even for a gesture of courtesy,
the fair creature had fled within, and the curtain
closed the entrance as before.
</p>

<p>
Wishing to recover his composure, so strangely
troubled, and taking it for granted that some other
inmate of the house would soon appear, Yuengtsoong
turned his steps aside to the grove, and with his
head bowed, and his spear in the hollow of his arm,
tried to recall more vividly the features of the vision
he had seen.  He had walked but a few paces, when
there came toward him from the upper skirt of the
grove a man of unusual stature and erectness, with
white hair, unbraided on his shoulders, and every
sign of age except infirmity of step and mien.  The
emperor's habitual dignity had now rallied, and on
his first salutation, the countenance of the old man
softened, and he quickened his pace to meet and
give him welcome.
</p>

<p>
"You are noble?" he said with confident inquiry.
</p>

<p>
Yuentsoong coloured slightly.
</p>

<p>
"I am," he replied, "Lew-melin, a prince of the
empire."
</p>

<p>
"And by what accident here?"
</p>

<p>
Yuentsoong explained the clue of the peach-blossoms,
and represented himself as exiled for a time
to the deserted palace upon the lakes.
</p>

<p>
"I have a daughter," said the old man, abruptly,
"who has never looked on human face save mine."
</p>

<p>
"Pardon me!" replied his visitor; "I have
thoughtlessly intruded on her sight, and a face more
heavenly fair&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
The emperor hesitated but the old man smiled
encouragingly.
</p>

<p>
"It is time," he said, "that I should provide a
younger defender for my bright Teh-leen, and
Heaven has sent you in the season of peach-blossoms,
with provident kindness.[*]  You have frankly
revealed to me your name and rank.  Before I offer
you the hospitality of my roof I must tell you mine.
I am Choo-tseen, the outlaw, once of your own
rank and the general of the Celestial army."
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="footnote">
[*]The season of peach-blossoms was the only season of
marriage in ancient China.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
The emperor started, remembering that this celebrated
rebel was the terror of his father's throne.
</p>

<p>
"You have heard my history," the old man continued.
"I had been, before my rebellion, in charge
of the imperial palace on the lake.  Anticipating an
evil day, I secretly prepared this retreat for my
family; and when my soldiers deserted me at the battle
of Ke-chow, and a price was set upon my head,
hither I fled with my women and children; and the
last alive is my beautiful Teh-leen.  With this brief
outline of my life, you are at liberty to leave me as
you came, or to enter my house, on the condition
that you become the protector of my child."
</p>

<p>
The emperor eagerly turned toward the pavilion,
and with a step as light as his own, the erect and
stately outlaw hastened to lift the curtain before
him.  Leaving his guest for a moment in the outer
apartment, he entered into an inner chamber in
search of his daughter, whom he brought, panting
with fear, and blushing with surprise and delight,
to her future lover and protector.  A portion of an
historical tale so delicate as the description of the
heroine is not work for imitators, however, and we
must copy strictly the portrait of the matchless
Teh-leen, as drawn by Le-pih, the Anacreon of
Chinese poetry, and the contemporary and favourite of
Yuentsoong.
</p>

<p>
"Teh-leen was born while the morning star shone
upon the bosom of her mother.  Her eye was like the
unblemished blue lily, with its light like the white
gem unfractured.  The plum-blossom is most
fragrant when the cold has penetrated its stem, and
the mother of Teh-leen had known sorrow.  The
head of her child drooped in thought, like a violet
overladen with dew.  Bewildering was Teh-leen.
Her mouth's corners were dimpled, yet pensive.
The arch of her brows was like the vein in the
tulip's heart, and the lashes shaded the blushes on her
cheek.  With the delicacy of a pale rose, her
complexion put to shame the floating light of day.  Her
waist, like a thread in fineness, seemed ready to
break; yet it was straight and erect, and feared not
the fanning breeze; and her shadowy grace was as
difficult to delineate as the form of a white bird
rising from the ground by moonlight.  The natural
gloss of her hair resembled the uncertain sheen of
calm water, yet without the aid of false unguents.
The native intelligence of her mind seemed to have
gained strength by retirement, and he who beheld
her, thought not of her as human.  Of rare beauty,
of rarer intellect was Teh-leen, and her heart
responded to the poet's lute."
</p>

<p>
We have not space, nor could we, without copying
from the admired Le-pih, venture to describe
the bringing of Teh-leen to court, and her surprise
at finding herself the favourite of the emperor.  It
is a romantic circumstance, besides, which has had
its parallels in other countries.  But the sad sequel
to the loves of poor Teh-leen is but recorded on the
cold page of history; and if the poet, who wound up
the climax of her perfections, with her susceptibility
to his lute, embalmed her sorrows in verse, he
was probably too politic to bring it ever to light.
Pass we to those neglected and unadorned passages
of her history.
</p>

<p>
Yuentsoong's nature was passionately devoted
and confiding; and like two brothers with one
favourite sister, lived together Teh-leen, Szema, and
the emperor.  The Tartar prince, if his heart knew
a mistress before the arrival of Teh-leen at the
palace, owned afterward no other than her; and
fearless of check or suspicion from the noble confidence
and generous friendship of Yuentsoong, he seemed
to live but for her service, and to have neither
energies nor ambitions except for the winning of
her smiles.  Szema was of great personal beauty,
frank when it did not serve him to be wily, bold in
his pleasures, and of manners almost femininely soft
and voluptuous.  He was renowned as a soldier,
and for Teh-leen, he became a poet and master of
the lute; and like all men formed for ensnaring the
hearts of women, he seemed to forget himself in the
absorbing devotion to his idolatry.  His friend, the
emperor, was of another mould.  Yuentsoong's
heart had three chambers&mdash;love, friendship, and
glory.  Teh-leen was but a third in his existence,
yet he loved her&mdash;the sequel will show how well!
In person he was less beautiful than majestic, of
large stature, and with a brow and lip naturally
stern and lofty.  He seldom smiled, even upon
Teh-leen, whom he would watch for hours in pensive
and absorbed delight; but his smile, when it did
awake, broke over his sad countenance like
morning.  All men loved and honoured Yuentsoong, and
all men, except only the emperor, looked on Szema
with antipathy.  To such natures as the former,
women give all honour and approbation; but for
such as the latter, they reserve their weakness!
</p>

<p>
Wrapt up in his friend and mistress, and reserved
in his intercourse with his counsellors, Yuentsoong
knew not that, throughout the imperial city, Szema
was called "<i>the kieu,</i>" or robber-bird, and his fair
Teh-leen openly charged with dishonour.  Going
out alone to hunt as was his custom, and having
left his signet with Szema, to pass and repass
through the private apartments at his pleasure, his
horse fell with him unaccountably in the open field.
Somewhat superstitious, and remembering that
good spirits sometimes "knit the grass," when other
obstacles fail to bar our way to danger, the emperor
drew rein and returned to his palace.  It was an
hour after noon, and having dismissed his attendants
at the city gate, he entered by a postern to the
imperial garden, and bethought himself of the concealed
couch in a cool grot by a fountain (a favourite
retreat, sacred to himself and Teh-leen), where
he fancied it would be refreshing to sleep away the
sultriness of the remaining hours till evening.
Sitting down by the side of the murmuring fount, he
bathed his feet, and left his slippers on the lip of
the basin to be unencumbered in his repose within,
and so with unechoing step entered the resounding
grotto.  Alas! there slumbered the faithless friend
with the guilty Teh-leen upon his bosom!
</p>

<p>
Grief struck through the noble heart of the
emperor like a sword in cold blood.  With a word he
could consign to torture and death the robber of his
honour, but there was agony in his bosom deeper
than revenge.  He turned silently away, recalled his
horse and huntsmen, and, outstripping all, plunged
on through the forest till night gathered around him.
</p>

<p>
Yuentsoong had been absent many days from his
capitol, and his subjects were murmuring their fears
for his safety, when a messenger arrived to the
counsellors informing them of the appointment of the
captive Tartar prince to the government of the
province of Szechuen, the second honour of the
Celestial empire.  A private order accompanied the
announcement, commanding the immediate departure
of Szema for the scene of his new authority.
Inexplicable as was this riddle to the multitude, there
were those who read it truly by their knowledge of
the magnanimous soul of the emperor; and among
these was the crafty object of his generosity.
Losing no time, he set forward with great pomp for
Szechuen, and in their joy to see him no more in
the palace, the slighted princes of the empire
forgave him his unmerited advancement.  Yuentsoong
returned to his capitol; but to the terror of his
counsellors and people, his hair was blanched white as
the head of an old man!  He was pale as well, but
he was cheerful beyond his wont, and to Teh-leen
untiring in pensive and humble attentions.  He
pleaded only impaired health and restless slumbers
for nights of solitude.  Once, Teh-leen penetrated
to his lonely chamber, but by the dim night lamp
she saw that the scroll over her window[*] was
changed, and instead of the stimulus to glory which
formerly hung in golden letters before his eyes,
there was a sentence written tremblingly in black:&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"<i>The close wing of love covers the death-throb of
honour.</i>"
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="footnote">
[*]The most common decorations of rooms, halls, and temples in China
are ornamental scrolls or labels of coloured paper,
or wood, painted and gilded,
and hung over doors or windows, and inscribed with a line or couplet
conveying some allusion to the circumstances
of the inhabitant, or some pious or
philosophical axiom.  For instance, a poetical one is recorded by
Dr. Morrison:
</p>

<p class="footnote">
"From the pine forest the azure dragon ascends to the milky way,"
typical of the prosperous man arising to wealth and honours.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
Six months from this period the capital was thrown
into a tumult with the intelligence that the province
of Szechuen was in rebellion, and Szema at the
head of a numerous army on his way to seize the
throne of Yuentsoong.  This last sting betrayed
the serpent even to the forgiving emperor, and
tearing the reptile at last from his heart, he entered
with the spirit of other times into warlike preparations.
The imperial army was in a few days on its
march, and at Keo-Yang the opposing forces met
and prepared for encounter.
</p>

<p>
With a dread of the popular feeling toward
Teh-leen, Yuentsoong had commanded for her a close
litter, and she was borne after the imperial standard
in the centre of the army.  On the eve before the
battle, ere the watch-fires were lit, the emperor
came to her tent, set apart from his own, and with
the delicate care and gentleness from which he
never varied, inquired how her wants were supplied,
and bade her, thus early, farewell for the night; his
own custom of passing among his soldiers on the
evening previous to an engagement, promising to
interfere with what was usually his last duty before
retiring to his couch.
</p>

<p>
Teh-leen on this occasion seemed moved by some
irrepressible emotion, and as he rose to depart, she
fell forward upon her face and bathed his feet with
her tears.  Attributing it to one of those excesses of
feeling to which all, but especially hearts ill at ease,
are liable, the noble monarch gently raised her, and,
with repeated efforts at reassurance, committed her
to the hands of her women.  His own heart beat
far from tranquilly, for, in the excess of his pity for
her grief, he had unguardedly called her by one of
the sweet names of their early days of love&mdash;strange
word now upon his lips&mdash;and it brought back, spite
of memory and truth, happiness that would not be
forgotten!
</p>

<p>
It was past midnight, and the moon was riding
high in heaven, when the emperor, returning
between the lengthening watch-fires, sought out the
small lamp, which, suspended like a star above his
own tent, guided him back from the irregular mazes
of the camp.  Paled by the intense radiance of the
moonlight, the small globe of alabaster at length
became apparent to his weary eye, and with one
glance at the peaceful beauty of the heavens, he
parted the curtained door beneath it, and stood
within.  The Chinese historian asserts that a bird,
from whose wing Teh-leen had once plucked an
arrow, restoring it to liberty and life, in grateful
attachment to her destiny, had removed the lamp
from the imperial tent and suspended it over hers.
The emperor stood beside her couch.  Startled at
his inadvertent error, he turned to retire; but the
lifted curtain let in a flood of moonlight upon the
sleeping features of Teh-leen, and like dew-drops
the undried tears glistened in her silken lashes.  A
lamp burned faintly in the inner apartment of the
tent and her attendants slept soundly.  His soft
heart gave way.  Taking up the lamp, he held it
over his beautiful mistress, and once more gazed
passionately and unrestrainedly on her unparalleled
beauty.  The past&mdash;the early past&mdash;was alone
before him.  He forgave her&mdash;there as she slept,
unconscious of the throbbing of his injured, but
noble heart, so close beside her&mdash;he forgave her in
the long silent abysses of his soul!  Unwilling to
wake her from her tranquil slumber, but promising
to himself from that hour such sweets of confiding
love as had well-nigh been lost to him forever,
he imprinted one kiss upon the parted lips of
Teh-leen, and sought his couch for slumber.
</p>

<p>
Ere daybreak the emperor was aroused by one of
his attendants with news too important for delay.
Szema, the rebel, had been arrested in the imperial
camp, disguised, and on his way back to his own
forces, and like wildfire, the information had spread
among the soldiery, who, in a state of mutinous
excitement, were with difficulty restrained from
rushing upon the tent of Teh-leen.  At the door
of his tent, Yuentsoong found messengers from the
alarmed princes and officers of the different
commands, imploring immediate aid and the imperial
presence to allay the excitement, and while the
emperor prepared to mount his horse, the guard
arrived with the Tartar prince, ignominiously tied,
and bearing marks of rough usage from his indignant
captors.
</p>

<p>
"Loose him!" cried the emperor in a voice of
thunder.
</p>

<p>
The cords were severed, and with a glance whose
ferocity expressed no thanks, Szema reared himself
up to his fullest height, and looked scornfully around
him.  Daylight had now broke, and as the group
stood upon an eminence in sight of the whole army,
shouts began to ascend, and the armed multitude,
breaking through all restraint, rolled in toward the
centre.  Attracted by the commotion, Yuentsoong
turned to give some orders to those near him, when
Szema suddenly sprang upon an officer of the guard,
wrenched his drawn sword from his grasp, and in an
instant was lost to sight in the tent of Teh-leen.
A sharp scream, a second of thought, and forth
again rushed the desperate murderer, with his sword
flinging drops of blood, and ere a foot stirred in the
paralysed group, the avenging cimiter of Yuentsoong
had cleft him to the chin.
</p>

<p>
A hush, as if the whole army were struck dumb by
a bolt from heaven, followed this rapid tragedy.
Dropping the polluted sword from his hand, the
emperor, with uncertain step, and the pallor of
death upon his countenance, entered the fatal tent.
</p>

<p>
He came no more forth that day.  The army was
marshalled by the princes, and the rebels were
routed with great slaughter; but Yuentsoong never
more wielded sword.  "He pined to death," says
the historian, "with the wane of the same moon
that shone upon the forgiveness of Teh-leen."

<p>
As the caique glided up to the garden gate
the three boatmen rose from their sheepskins
and caught hold of iron clamps set into the
marble of the quay.  Shaban, the grizzled
gate-keeper, who was standing at the top of the
water-steps with his hands folded respectfully in front of
him, came salaaming down to help his master out.
</p>

<p>
"Shall we wait, my Pasha?" asked the head
<i>kaikji</i>.
</p>

<p>
The Pasha turned to Shaban, as if to put a
question.  And as if to answer it Shaban said:
</p>

<p>
"The Madama is up in the wood, in the kiosque.
She sent down word to ask if you would go up too."
</p>

<p>
"Then don't wait."  Returning the boatmen's
salaam, the Pasha stepped into his garden.  "Is
there company in the kiosque or is Madama alone?"
he inquired.
</p>

<p>
"I think no one is there&mdash;except Zümbül Agha,"
replied Shaban, following his master up the long
central path of black and white pebbles.
</p>

<p>
"Zümbül Agha!" exclaimed the Pasha.  But
if it had been in his mind to say anything else he
stopped instead to sniff at a rosebud.  And then
he asked: "Are we dining up there, do you
know?"
</p>

<p>
"I don't know, my Pasha, but I will find out."
</p>

<p>
"Tell them to send up dinner anyway, Shaban.
It is such an evening!  And just ask Moustafa to
bring me a coffee at the fountain, will you?  I will
rest a little before climbing that hill."
</p>

<p>
"On my head!" said the Albanian, turning off
to the house.
</p>

<p>
The Pasha kept on to the end of the walk.  Two
big horse-chestnut trees, their candles just starting
alight in the April air, stood there at the foot of a
terrace, guarding a fountain that dripped in the
ivied wall.  A thread of water started mysteriously
out of the top of a tall marble niche into a little
marble basin, from which it overflowed by two flat
bronze spouts into two smaller basins below.  From
them the water dripped back into a single basin
still lower down, and so tinkled its broken way, past
graceful arabesques and reliefs of fruit and flowers,
into a crescent-shaped pool at the foot of the niche.
</p>

<p>
The Pasha sank down into one of the wicker
chairs scattered hospitably beneath the
horse-chestnut trees, and thought how happy a man
he was to have a fountain of the period of Sultan
Ahmed III, and a garden so full of April freshness,
and a view of the bright Bosphorus and the opposite
hills of Europe and the firing West.  How definitely
he thought it I cannot say, for the Pasha was not
greatly given to thought.  Why should he be, since
he possessed without that trouble a goodly share of
what men acquire by taking thought?  If he had
been lapped in ease and security all his days, they
numbered many more, did those days, than the
Pasha would have chosen.  Still, they had touched
him but lightly, merely increasing the dignity of
his handsome presence and taking away nothing of
his power to enjoy his little walled world.
</p>

<p>
So he sat there, breathing in the air of the place
and the hour, while gardeners came and went with
their watering-pots, and birds twittered among the
branches, and the fountain plashed beside him, until
Shaban reappeared carrying a glass of water and a
cup of coffee in a swinging tray.
</p>

<p>
"Eh, Shaban!  It is not your business to carry
coffee!" protested the Pasha, reaching for a stand
that stood near him.
</p>

<p>
"What is your business is my business, <i>Pasha'm</i>.
Have I not eaten your bread and your father's for
thirty years?"
</p>

<p>
"No!  Is it as long as that?  We are getting old,
Shaban."
</p>

<p>
"We are getting old," assented the Albanian
simply.
</p>

<p>
The Pasha thought, as he took out his silver
cigarette-case, of another Pasha who had
complimented him that afternoon on his youthfulness.
And, choosing a cigarette, he handed the case to his
gatekeeper.  Shaban accepted the cigarette and
produced matches from his gay girdle.
</p>

<p>
"How long is it since you have been to your
country, Shaban?"
</p>

<p>
The Pasha, lifting his little cup by its silver zarf,
realised that he would not have sipped his coffee
quite so noisily had his French wife been sitting with
him under the horse-chestnut trees.  But with his
old Shaban he could still be a Turk.
</p>

<p>
"Eighteen months, my Pasha."
</p>

<p>
"And when are you going again?"
</p>

<p>
"In Ramazan, if God wills.  Or perhaps next
Ramazan.  We shall see."
</p>

<p>
"Allah, Allah!  How many times have I told you
to bring your people here, Shaban?  We have plenty
of room to build you a house somewhere, and you
could see your wife and children every day instead
of once in two or three years."
</p>

<p>
"Wives, wives&mdash;a man will not die if he does not
see them every day!  Besides, it would not be good
for the children.  In Constantinople they become
rascals.  There are too many Christians."  And he
added hastily: "It is better for a boy to grow up in
the mountains."
</p>

<p>
"But we have a mountain here, behind the house,"
laughed the Pasha.
</p>

<p>
"Your mountain is not like our mountains," objected
Shaban gravely, hunting in his mind for the
difference he felt but could not express.
</p>

<p>
"And that new wife of yours," went on the Pasha.
"Is it good to leave a young woman like that?  Are
you not afraid?"
</p>

<p>
"No, my Pasha.  I am not afraid.  We all live
together, you know.  My brothers watch, and the
other women.  She is safer than yours.  Besides, in
my country it is not as it is here."
</p>

<p>
"I don't know why I have never been to see this
wonderful country of yours, Shaban.  I have so
long intended to, and I never have been.  But I must
climb my mountain or they will think I have become
a rascal too."  And, rising from his chair, he gave
the Albanian a friendly pat.
</p>

<p>
"Shall I come too, my Pasha?  Zümbül Agha sent
word&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Zümbül Agha!" interrupted the Pasha irritably.
"No, you needn't come.  I will explain to Zümbül
Agha."
</p>

<p>
With which he left Shaban to pick up the empty
coffee cup.
</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<p class="t3">
II
</p>

<p>
From the upper terrace a bridge led across the
public road to the wood.  If it was not a wood it was
at all events a good-sized grove, climbing the steep
hillside very much as it chose.  Every sort and size
of tree was there, but the greater number of them
were of a kind to be sparsely trimmed in April with
a delicate green, and among them were so many
twisted Judas trees as to tinge whole patches of the
slope with their deep rose bloom.  The road that
the Pasha slowly climbed, swinging his amber beads
behind him as he walked, zigzagged so leisurely back
and forth among the trees that a carriage could have
driven up it.  In that way, indeed, the Pasha had
more than once mounted to the kiosque, in the days
when his mother used to spend a good part of her
summer up there, and when he was married to his
first wife.  The memory of the two, and of their
old-fashioned ways, entered not too bitterly into his
general feeling of well-being, ministered to by the
budding trees and the spring air and the sunset view.
Every now and then an enormous plane tree invited
him to stop and look at it, or a semi-circle of
cypresses.
</p>

<p>
So at last he came to the top of the hill, where in
a grassy clearing a small house looked down on the
valley of the Bosphorus through a row of great stone
pines.  The door of the kiosque was open, but his
wife was not visible.  The Pasha stopped a moment,
as he had done a thousand times before, and looked
back.  He was not the man to be insensible to what
he saw between the columnar trunks of the pines,
where European hills traced a dark curve against the
fading sky, and where the sinuous waterway far
below still reflected a last glamour of the day.  The
beauty of it, and the sharp sweetness of the April air,
and the infinitesimal sounds of the wood, and the
half-conscious memories involved with it all, made
him sigh.  He turned and mounted the steps of the
porch.
</p>

<p>
The kiosque looked very dark and unfamiliar as
the Pasha entered it.  He wondered what had become
of Hélène&mdash;if by any chance he had passed her
on the way.  He wanted her.  She was the expression
of what the evening roused in him.  He heard
nothing, however, but the splash of water from a
half-visible fountain.  It reminded him for an instant of
the other fountain, below, and of Shaban.  His steps
resounded hollowly on the marble pavement as he
walked into the dim old saloon, shaped like a T, with
the crossbar longer than the leg.  It was still light
enough for him to make out the glimmer of windows
on three sides and the square of the fountain in the
centre, but the painted domes above were lost in
shadow.
</p>

<p>
The spaces on either side of the bay by which he
entered, completing the rectangle of the kiosque,
were filled by two little rooms opening into the cross
of the T.  He went into the left-hand one, where
Hélène usually sat&mdash;because there were no lattices.
The room was empty.  The place seemed so strange
and still in the twilight that a sort of apprehension
began to grow in him, and he half wished he had
brought up Shaban.  He turned back to the second,
the latticed room&mdash;the harem, as they called it.
Curiously enough it was Hélène who would never let
him Europeanise it, in spite of the lattices.  Every
now and then he found out that she liked some
Turkish things better than he did.  As soon as he
opened the door he saw her sitting on the divan
opposite.  He knew her profile against the checkered
pallor of the lattice.  But she neither moved nor
greeted him.  It was Zümbül Agha who did so,
startling him by suddenly rising beside the door and
saying in his high voice:
</p>

<p>
"Pleasant be your coming, my Pasha."
</p>

<p>
The Pasha had forgotten about Zümbül Agha;
and it seemed strange to him that Hélène continued
to sit silent and motionless on her sofa.
</p>

<p>
"Good evening," he said at last.  "You are sitting
very quietly here in the dark.  Are there no lights in
this place?"
</p>

<p>
It was again Zümbül Agha who spoke, turning
one question by another:
</p>

<p>
"Did Shaban come with you?"
</p>

<p>
"No," replied the Pasha shortly.  "He said he had
a message, but I told him not to come."
</p>

<p>
"A-ah!" ejaculated the eunuch in his high drawl.
"But it does not matter&mdash;with the two of us."
</p>

<p>
The Pasha grew more and more puzzled, for this
was not the scene he had imagined to himself as he
came up through the part in response to his wife's
message.  Nor did he grow less puzzled when the
eunuch turned to her and said in another tone:
</p>

<p>
"Now will you give me that key?"
</p>

<p>
The French woman took no more notice of this
question than she had of the Pasha's entrance.
</p>

<p>
"What do you mean, Zümbül Agha?" demanded
the Pasha sharply.  "That is not the way to speak
to your mistress."
</p>

<p>
"I mean this, my Pasha," retorted the eunuch&mdash;"that
some one is hiding in this chest and that
Madama keeps the key."
</p>

<p>
That was what the Pasha heard, in the absurd
treble of the black man, in the darkening room.  He
looked down and made out, beside the tall figure of
the eunuch, the chest on which he had been sitting.
Then he looked across at Hélène, who still sat silent
in front of the lattice.
</p>

<p>
"What are you talking about?" he asked at last,
more stupefied than anything else.  "Who is it?
A thief?  Has any one&mdash;?"  He left the vague
question unformulated, even in his mind.
</p>

<p>
"Ah, that I don't know.  You must ask Madama.
Probably it is one of her Christian friends.  But at
least if it were a woman she would not be so unwilling
to unlock her chest for us!"
</p>

<p>
The silence that followed, while the Pasha looked
dumbly at the chest, and at Zümbül Agha, and at
his wife, was filled for him with a stranger confusion
of feelings than he had ever experienced before.
Nevertheless he was surprisingly cool, he found.
His pulse quickened very little.  He told himself
that it wasn't true and that he really must get rid
of old Zümbül after all, if he went on making such
preposterous gaffes and setting them all by the ears.
How could anything so baroque happen to him, the
Pasha, who owed what he was to honourable fathers
and who had passed his life honourably and peaceably
until this moment?  Yet he had had an impression,
walking into the dark old kiosque and finding
nobody until he found these two sitting here in this
extraordinary way&mdash;as if he had walked out of his
familiar garden, that he knew like his hand, into a
country he knew nothing about, where anything
might be true.  And he wished, he almost
passionately wished, that Hélène would say something,
would cry out against Zümbül Agha, would lie even,
rather than sit there so still and removed and
different from other women.
</p>

<p>
Then he began to be aware that if it were true&mdash;if!&mdash;he
ought to do something.  He ought to make
a noise.  He ought to kill somebody.  That was
what they always did.  That was what his father
would have done, or certainly his grandfather.  But
he also told himself that it was no longer possible
for him to do what his father and grandfather had
done.  He had been unlearning their ways too long.
Besides, he was too old.
</p>

<p>
A sudden sting pierced him at the thought of how
old he was, and how young Hélène.  Even if he
lived to be seventy or eighty she would still have a
life left when he died.  Yes, it was as Shaban said.
They were getting old.  He had never really felt
the humiliation of it before.  And Shaban had said,
strangely, something else&mdash;that his own wife was
safer than the Pasha's.  Still he felt an odd
compassion for Hélène, too&mdash;because she was young, and
it was Judas-tree time, and she was married to grey
hairs.  And although he was a Pasha, descended
from great Pashas, and she was only a little French
girl <i>quelconque</i>, he felt more afraid than ever of
making a fool of himself before her&mdash;when he had
promised her that she should be as free as any other
European woman, that she should live her life.
Besides, what had the black man to do with their
private affairs?
</p>

<p>
"Zümbül Agha," he suddenly heard himself
harshly saying, "is this your house or mine?  I
have told you a hundred times that you are not to
trouble the Madama, or follow her about, or so
much as guess where she is and what she is doing.
I have kept you in the house because my father
brought you into it; but if I ever hear of you
speaking to Madama again, or spying on her, I will send
you into the street.  Do you hear?  Now get out!"
</p>

<p>
"Aman, my Pasha!  I beg you!" entreated the
eunuch.  There was something ludicrous in his
voice, coming as it did from his height.
</p>

<p>
The Pasha wondered if he had been too long a
person of importance in the family to realise the
change in his position, or whether he really&mdash;&mdash;
</p>

<p>
All of a sudden a checkering of lamplight flickered
through the dark window, touched the Negro's
black face for a moment, travelled up the wall.
Silence fell again in the little room&mdash;a silence into
which the fountain dropped its silver patter.  Then
steps mounted the porch and echoed in the other
room, which lighted in turn, and a man came in
sight, peering this way and that, with a big white
accordeon lantern in his hand.  Behind the man two
other servants appeared, carrying on their heads
round wooden trays covered by figured silks, and a
boy tugging a huge basket.  When they discovered
the three in the little room they salaamed
respectfully.
</p>

<p>
"Where shall we set the table?" asked the man
with the lantern.
</p>

<p>
For the Pasha the lantern seemed to make the
world more like the place he had always known.  He
turned to his wife, apologetically.
</p>

<p>
"I told them to send dinner up here.  It has
been such a long time since we came.  But I
forgot about the table.  I don't believe there is
one here."
</p>

<p>
"No," uttered Hélène from her sofa, sitting with
her head on her hand.
</p>

<p>
It was the first word she had spoken.  But, little
as it was, it reassured him, like the lantern.
</p>

<p>
"There is the chest," hazarded Zümbül Agha.
</p>

<p>
The interruption of the servants had for the
moment distracted them all.  But the Pasha now
turned on him so vehemently that the eunuch salaamed
in haste and went away.
</p>

<p>
"Why not?" asked Hélène, when he was gone.
"We can sit on the cushions."
</p>

<p>
"Why not?" echoed the Pasha.  Grateful as he
was for the interruption, he found himself wishing,
secretly, that Hélène had discouraged his idea of a
picnic dinner.  And he could not help feeling a
certain constraint as he gave the necessary orders and
watched the servants put down their paraphernalia
and pull the chest into the middle of the room.
There was something unreal and stage-like about
the scene, in the uncertain light of the lantern.
Obviously the chest was not light.  It was an old
cypress-wood chest that they had always used in the
summer, to keep things in, polished a bright brown,
with a little inlaid pattern of dark brown and cream
colour running around the edge of each surface, and
a more complicated design ornamenting the centre
of the cover.  He vaguely associated his mother
with it.  He felt a distinct relief when the men
spread the cloth.  He felt as if they had covered up
more things than he could name.  And when they
produced candlesticks and candles, and set them on
the improvised table and in the niches beside the
door, he seemed to come back again into the
comfortable light of common sense.
</p>

<p>
"This is the way we used to do when I was a
boy," he said with a smile, when he and Hélène
established themselves on sofa cushions on opposite
sides of the chest.  "Only then we had little tables
six inches high, instead of big ones like this."
</p>

<p>
"It is rather a pity that we have spoiled all
that," she said.  "Are we any happier for perching
on chairs around great scaffoldings, and piling the
scaffoldings with so many kinds of porcelain and
metal?  After all, they knew how to live&mdash;the
people who were capable of imagining a place like this.
And they had the good taste not to fill a room with
things.  Your grandfather, was it?"
</p>

<p>
He had had a dread that she would not say anything,
that she would remain silent and impenetrable
as she had been before Zümbül Agha, as if
the chest between them were a barrier that nothing
could surmount.  His heart lightened when he
heard her speak.  Was it not quite her natural
voice?
</p>

<p>
"It was my great-grandfather, the Grand Vizier.
They say he did know how to live&mdash;in his way.  He
built the kiosque for a beautiful slave of his, a
Greek, whom he called Pomegranate."
</p>

<p>
"Madame Pomegranate!  What a charming
name!  And that is why her cipher is everywhere.
See?"  She pointed to the series of cupboards and
niches on either side of the door, dimly painted with
pomegranate blossoms, and to the plaster reliefs
around the hooded fireplace, and to the cluster of
pomegranates that made a centre to the gilt and
painted lattice-work of the ceiling.  "One could be
very happy in such a little house.  It has an
air&mdash;of being meant for moments.  And you feel as if
they had something to do with the wonderful way
it has faded."  She looked as if she had meant to
say something else, which she did not.  But after a
moment she added: "Will you ask them to turn
off the water in the fountain?  It is a little chilly,
now that the sun has gone, and it sounds like
rain&mdash;or tears."
</p>

<p>
The dinner went, on the whole, not so badly.
There were dishes to be passed back and forth.
There were questions to be asked or comments to
be made.  There were the servants to be spoken to.
Yet, more and more, the Pasha could not help
wondering.  When a silence fell, too, he could not help
listening.  And least of all could he help looking at
Hélène.  He looked at her, trying not to look at
her, with an intense curiosity, as if he had never
seen her before, asking himself if there were
anything new in her face, and how she would look
if&mdash;  Would she be like this?  She made no attempt to
keep up a flow of words, as if to distract his
attention.  She was not soft either; she was not trying to
seduce him.  And she made no show of gratitude
toward him for having sent Zümbül Agha away.
Neither did she by so much as an inflection try to
insinuate or excuse or explain.  She was what she
always was, perfect&mdash;and evidently a little tired.
She was indeed more than perfect, she was prodigious,
when he asked her once what she was thinking
about and she said Pandora, tapping the chest
between them.  He had never heard the story of that
other Greek girl and her box, and she told him
gravely about all the calamities that came out of
it, and the one gift of hope that remained behind.
</p>

<p>
"But I cannot be a Turkish woman long!" she
added inconsequently with a smile.  "My legs are
asleep.  I really must walk about a little."
</p>

<p>
When he had helped her to her feet she led the
way into the other room.  They had their coffee
and cigarettes there.  Hélène walked slowly up
and down the length of the room, stopping every
now and then to look into the square pool of the
fountain and to pat her hair.
</p>

<p>
The Pasha sat down on the long low divan that
ran under the windows.  He could watch her more
easily now.  And the detachment with which he
had begun to look at her grew in spite of him into
the feeling that he was looking at a stranger.  After
all, what did he know about her?  Who was she?
What had happened to her, during all the years that
he had not known her, in that strange free European
life which he had tried to imitate, and which at heart
he secretly distrusted?  What had she ever really
told him, and what had he ever really divined of
her?  For perhaps the first time in his life he realised
how little one person may know of another, and
particularly a man of a woman.  And he remembered
Shaban again, and that phrase about his wife
being safer than Hélène.  Had Shaban really
meant anything?  Was Hélène "safe"?  He
acknowledged to himself at last that the question was
there in his mind, waiting to be answered.
</p>

<p>
Hélène did not help him.  She had been standing
for some time at an odd angle to the pool, looking
into it.  He could see her face there, with the
eyes turned away from him.
</p>

<p>
"How mysterious a reflection is!" she said.
"It is so real that you can't believe it disappears
for good.  How often Madame Pomegranate must
have looked into this pool, and yet I can't find her
in it.  But I feel she is really there, all the
same&mdash;and who knows who else."
</p>

<p>
"They say mirrors do not flatter," the Pasha
did not keep himself from rejoining, "but they are
very discreet.  They tell no tales!"
</p>

<p>
Hélène raised her eyes.  In the little room the
servants had cleared the improvised table and
had packed up everything again except the
candles.
</p>

<p>
"I have been up here a long time," she said,
"and I am rather tired.  It is a little cold, too.
If you do not mind I think I will go down to the
house now, with the servants.  You will hardly
care to go so soon, for Zümbül Agha has not finished
what he has to say to you."
</p>

<p>
"Zümbül Agha!" exclaimed the Pasha.  "I sent
him away."
</p>

<p>
"Ah, but you must know him well enough to be
sure he would not go.  Let us see."  She clapped
her hands.  The servant of the lantern immediately
came out to her.  "Will you ask Zümbül Agha to
come here?" she said.  "He is on the porch."
</p>

<p>
The man went to the door, looked out, and said
a word.  Then he stood aside with a respectful
salaam, and the eunuch entered.  He negligently
returned the salute and walked forward until his
air of importance changed to one of humility at
sight of the Pasha.  Salaaming in turn, he stood
with his hands folded in front of him.
</p>

<p>
"I will go down with you," said the Pasha to
his wife, rising.  "It is too late for you to go through
the woods in the dark."
</p>

<p>
"Nonsense!"  She gave him a look that had
more in it than the tone in which she added: "Please
do not.  I shall be perfectly safe with four servants.
You can tell them not to let me run away."  Coming
nearer, she put her hand into the bosom of her
dress, then stretched out the hand toward him.
"Here is the key&mdash;the key of which Zümbül Agha
spoke&mdash;the key of Pandora's box.  Will you keep
it for me, please?  <i>Au revoir</i>."
</p>

<p>
And making a sign to the servants she walked
out of the kiosque.
</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<p class="t3">
III
</p>

<p>
The Pasha was too surprised, at first, to move&mdash;and
too conscious of the eyes of servants, too
uncertain of what he should do, too fearful of doing
the wrong, the un-European, thing.  And afterward
it was too late.  He stood watching until the
flicker of the lantern disappeared among the dark
trees.  Then his eyes met the eunuch's.
</p>

<p>
"Why don't you go down too?" suggested Zümbül
Agha.  The variable climate of a great house
had made him too perfect an opportunist not to
take the line of being in favour again.  "It
might be better.  Give me the key and I will
do what there is to do.  But you might send up
Shaban."
</p>

<p>
Why not, the Pasha secretly asked himself?
Might it not be the best way out?  At the same
time he experienced a certain revulsion of feeling,
now that Hélène was gone, in the way she had gone.
She really was prodigious!  And with the vanishing
of the lantern that had brought him a measure of
reassurance he felt the weight of an uncleared
situation, fantastic but crucial, heavy upon him.  And
the Negro annoyed him intensely.
</p>

<p>
"Thank you, Zümbül Agha," he replied, "but
I am not the nurse of Madama, and I will not give
you the key."
</p>

<p>
If he only might, though, he thought to himself
again!
</p>

<p>
"You believe her, this Frank woman whom
you had never seen five years ago, and you do not
believe me who have lived in your house longer
than you can remember!"
</p>

<p>
The eunuch said it so bitterly that the Pasha
was touched in spite of himself.  He had never
been one to think very much about minor personal
relations, but even at such a moment he could
see&mdash;was it partly because he wanted more time to make
up his mind?&mdash;that he had never liked Zümbül
Agha as he liked Shaban, for instance.  Yet more
honour had been due, in the old family tradition,
to the former.  And he had been associated even
longer with the history of the house.
</p>

<p>
"My poor Zümbül," he uttered musingly,
"you have never forgiven me for marrying her."
</p>

<p>
"My Pasha, you are not the first to marry an
unbeliever, nor the last.  But such a marriage
should be to the glory of Islam, and not to its
discredit.  Who can trust her?  She is still a
Christian.  And she is too young.  She has turned the
world upside down.  What would your father have
said to a daughter-in-law who goes shamelessly into
the street without a veil, alone, and who receives
in your house men who are no relation to you or to
her?  It is not right.  Women understand only
one thing&mdash;to make fools of men.  And they are
never content to fool one."
</p>

<p>
The Pasha, still waiting to make up his mind,
let his fancy linger about Zümbül Agha.  It was
really rather absurd, after all, what a part women
played in the world, and how little it all came to
in the end!  Did the black man, he wondered,
walk in a clearer cooler world, free of the clouds,
the iridescences, the languors, the perfumes, the
strange obsessions, that made others walk so often
like madmen?  Or might some tatter of preposterous
humanity still work obscurely in him?  Or a
bitterness of not being like other men?  That
perhaps was why the Pasha felt friendlier toward
Shaban.  They were more alike.
</p>

<p>
"You are right, Zümbül Agha," he said.  "The
world is upside down.  But neither the Madama
nor any of us made it so.  All we can do is to try
and keep our heads as it turns.  Now, will you
please tell me how you happened to be up here?
The Madama never told you to come.  You know
perfectly well that the customs of Europe are
different from ours, and that she does not like to have
you follow her about."
</p>

<p>
"What woman likes to be followed about?"
retorted the eunuch with a sly smile.  "I know
you have told me to leave her alone.  But why
was I brought into this house?  Am I to stand by
and watch dishonour brought upon it simply because
you have eaten the poison of a woman?"
</p>

<p>
"Zümbül Agha," replied the Pasha sharply, "I
am not discussing old and new or this and that, but
I am asking you to tell me what all this speech is
about."
</p>

<p>
"Give me that key and I will show you what it is
about," said the eunuch, stepping forward.
</p>

<p>
But the Pasha found he was not ready to go so
directly to the point.
</p>

<p>
"Can't you answer a simple question?" he demanded
irritably, retreating to the farther side of
the fountain.
</p>

<p>
The reflection of the painted ceiling in the pool
made him think of Hélène&mdash;and Madame
Pomegranate.  He stared into the still water as if to find
Hélène's face there.  Was any other face hidden
beside it, mocking him?
</p>

<p>
But Zümbül Agha had begun again, doggedly:
</p>

<p>
"I came here because it is my business to be here.
I went to town this morning.  When I got back
they told me that you were away and that the
Madama was up here, alone.  So I came.  Is
this a place for a woman to be alone in&mdash;a young
woman, with men working all about and I don't
know who, and a thousand ways of getting in and
out from the hills, and ten thousand hiding places
in the woods?"
</p>

<p>
The Pasha made a gesture of impatience, and
turned away.  But after all, what could one do
with old Zümbül?  He had been brought up in
his tradition.  The Pasha lighted another cigarette
to help himself think.
</p>

<p>
"Well, I came up here," continued the eunuch,
"and as I came I heard Madama singing.  You know
how she sings the songs of the Franks."
</p>

<p>
The Pasha knew, but he did not say anything.
As he walked up and down, smoking and thinking,
his eye caught in the pool a reflection from the other
side of the room, where the door of the latticed room
was and where the cypress-wood chest stood as the
servants had left it in the middle of the floor.  Was
that what Hélène had stood looking at so long, he
asked himself?  He wondered that he could have sat
beside it so quietly.  It seemed now like something
dark and dangerous crouching there in the shadow
of the little room.
</p>

<p>
"I sat down, under the terrace," he heard the
eunuch go on, "where no one could see me, and I
listened.  And after she had stopped I heard&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Never mind what you heard," broke in the
Pasha.  "I have heard enough."
</p>

<p>
He was ashamed&mdash;ashamed and resolved.  He
felt as if he had been playing the spy with Zümbül
Agha.  And after all there was a very simple way
to answer his question for himself.  He threw
away his cigarette, went forward into the little
room, bent over the chest, and fitted the key into
the lock.
</p>

<p>
Just then a nightingale burst out singing, but so
near and so loud that he started and looked over his
shoulder.  In an instant he collected himself, feeling
the black man's eyes upon him.  Yet he could not
suppress the train of association started by the
impassioned trilling of the bird, even as he began to turn
the key of the chest where his mother used to keep
her quaint old silks and embroideries.  The irony of
the contrast paralysed his hand for a strange
moment, and of the difference between this spring night
and other spring nights when nightingales had sung.
And what if, after all, only calamity were to come
out of the chest, and he were to lose his last gift of
hope!  Ah!  He knew at last what he would do!  He
quickly withdrew the key from the lock, stood up
straight again, and looked at Zümbül Agha.
</p>

<p>
"Go down and get Shaban," he ordered, "and
don't come back."
</p>

<p>
The eunuch stared.  But if he had anything to say
he thought better of uttering it.  He saluted silently
and went away.
</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<p class="t3">
IV
</p>

<p>
The Pasha sat down on the divan and lighted a
cigarette.  Almost immediately the nightingale
stopped singing.  For a few moments Zümbül Agha's
steps could be heard outside.  Then it became very
still.  The Pasha did not like it.  Look which way he
would he could not help seeing the chest&mdash;or listening.
He got up and went into the big room, where
he turned on the water of the fountain.  The falling
drops made company for him, and kept him from
looking for lost reflections.  But they presently made
him think of what Hélène had said about them.  He
went out to the porch and sat down on the steps.  In
front of him the pines lifted their great dark canopies
against the stars.  Other stars twinkled between the
trunks, far below, where the shore lights of the
Bosphorus were.  It was so still that water sounds
came faintly up to him, and every now and then he
could even hear nightingales on the European side.
Another nightingale began singing in his own
woods&mdash;the nightingale that had told him what to do, he
said to himself.  What other things the nightingales
had sung to him, years ago!  And how long the pines
had listened there, still strong and green and rugged
and alive, while he, and how many before him, sat
under them for a little while and then went
away!
</p>

<p>
Presently he heard steps on the drive and Shaban
came, carrying something dark in his hand.
</p>

<p>
"What is that?" asked the Pasha, as Shaban held
it out.
</p>

<p>
"A pistol, my Pasha.  Zümbül Agha told me you
wanted it."
</p>

<p>
The Pasha laughed curtly.
</p>

<p>
"Zümbül made a mistake.  What I want is a
shovel, or a couple of them.  Can you find such a
thing without asking anyone?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, my Pasha," replied the Albanian promptly,
laying the revolver on the steps and disappearing
again.  And it was not long before he was back with
the desired implements.
</p>

<p>
"We must dig a hole, somewhere, Shaban," said
his master in a low voice.  "It must be in a place
where people are not likely to go, but not too far
from the kiosque."
</p>

<p>
Shaban immediately started toward the trees at
the back of the house.  The Pasha followed him
silently into a path that wound through the wood.
A nightingale began to sing again, very near
them&mdash;the nightingale, thought the Pasha.
</p>

<p>
"He is telling us where to go," he said.
</p>

<p>
Shaban permitted himself a low laugh.
</p>

<p>
"I think he is telling his mistress where to go.
However, we will go too."  And they did, bearing
away to one side of the path till they came to the
foot of a tall cypress.
</p>

<p>
"This will do," said the Pasha, "if the roots are
not in the way."
</p>

<p>
Without a word Shaban began to dig.  The Pasha
took the other spade.  To the simple Albanian it was
nothing out of the ordinary.  What was extraordinary
was that his master was able to keep it up, soft
as the loam was under the trees.  The most difficult
thing about it was that they could not see what they
were doing, except by the light of an occasional
match.  But at last the Pasha judged the ragged
excavation of sufficient depth.  Then he led the way
back to the kiosque.
</p>

<p>
They found Zümbül Agha in the little room, sitting
on the sofa with a pistol in either hand.
</p>

<p>
"I thought I told you not to come back!" exclaimed
the Pasha sternly.
</p>

<p>
"Yes," faltered the old eunuch, "but I was afraid
something might happen to you.  So I waited below
the pines.  And when you went away into the
woods with Shaban, I came here to watch."  He
lifted a revolver significantly.  "I found the other
one on the steps."
</p>

<p>
"Very well," said the Pasha at length, more
kindly.  He even found it in him at that moment to
be amused at the picture the black man made, in
his sedate frock coat, with his two weapons.  And
Zümbül Agha found no less to look at in the appearance
of his master's clothes.  "But now there is no
need for you to watch any longer," added the latter.
"If you want to watch, do it at the bottom of the
hill.  Don't let any one come up here."
</p>

<p>
"On my head," said the eunuch.  He saw that
Shaban, as usual, was trusted more than he.  But
it was not for him to protest against the ingratitude
of masters.  He salaamed and backed out of the
room.
</p>

<p>
When he was gone the Pasha turned to Shaban:
</p>

<p>
"This box, Shaban&mdash;you see this box?  It has
become a trouble to us, and I am going to take it out
there."
</p>

<p>
The Albanian nodded gravely.  He took hold of
one of the handles, to judge the weight of the chest.
He lifted his eyebrows.
</p>

<p>
"Can you help me put it on my back?" he asked.
</p>

<p>
"Don't try to do that, Shaban.  We will carry it
together."  The Pasha took hold of the other handle.
When they got as far as the outer door he let down
his end.  It was not light.  "Wait a minute, Shaban.
Let us shut up the kiosque, so that no one will notice
anything."  He went back to blow out the candles.
Then he thought of the fountain.  He caught a play
of broken images in the pool as he turned off the
water.  When he had put out the lights and had
groped his way to the door he found that Shaban
was already gone with the chest.  A last drop of
water made a strange echo behind him in the dark
kiosque.  He locked the door and hurried after
Shaban, who had succeeded in getting the chest on his
back.  Nor would Shaban let the Pasha help him till
they came to the edge of the wood.  There, carrying
the chest between them, they stumbled through the
trees to the place that was ready.
</p>

<p>
"Now we must be careful," said the Pasha.  "It
might slip or get stuck."
</p>

<p>
"But are you going to bury the box too?" demanded
Shaban, for the first time showing surprise.
</p>

<p>
"Yes," answered the Pasha.  And he added: "It
is the box I want to get rid of."
</p>

<p>
"It is a pity," remarked Shaban regretfully.  "It
is a very good box.  However, you know.  Now
then!"
</p>

<p>
There was a scraping and a muffled thud, followed
by a fall of earth and small stones on wood.  The
Pasha wondered if he would hear anything else.  But
first one and then another nightingale began to fill
the night air with their April madness.
</p>

<p>
"Ah, there are two of them," remarked Shaban.
"She will take the one that says the sweetest things
to her."
</p>

<p>
The Pasha's reply was to throw a spadeful of
earth on the chest.  Shaban joined him with such
vigour that the hole was very soon full.
</p>

<p>
"We are old, my Pasha, but we are good for
something yet," said Shaban.  "I will hide the
shovels here in the bushes," he added, "and early in
the morning I will come again, before any of those
lazy gardeners are up, and fix it so that no one will
ever know."
</p>

<p>
There at least was a person of whom one could be
sure!  The Pasha realised that gratefully, as they
walked back through the park.  He did not feel like
talking, but at least he felt the satisfaction of having
done what he had decided to do.  He remembered
Zümbül Agha as they neared the bottom of the hill.
The eunuch had not taken his commission more
seriously than it had been given, however, or he
preferred not to be seen.  Perhaps he wanted to
reconnoitre again on top of the hill.
</p>

<p>
"I don't think I will go in just yet," said the
Pasha, as they crossed the bridge into the lower
garden.  "I am rather dirty.  And I would like to
rest a little under the chestnut trees.  Would you
get me an overcoat please, Shaban, and a brush of
some kind?  And you might bring me a coffee, too."
</p>

<p>
How tired he was!  And what a short time it was,
yet what an eternity, since he last dropped into one
of those wicker chairs!  He felt for his cigarettes.
As he did so he discovered something else in his
pocket, something small and hard that at first he did
not recognise.  Then he remembered the key&mdash;the
key....  He suddenly tossed it into the pool
beside him.  It made a sharp little splash, which was
reëchoed by the dripping basins.  He got up and felt
in the ivy for the handle that shut off the water.  At
the end of the garden the Bosphorus lapped softly in
the dark.  Far away, up in the wood, the nightingales
were singing.

THE QUEST OF THE GOLDEN FLEECE*
</h3>

<p class="t3">
SIR HUGH CLIFFORD
</p>

<p class="noindent">
*Reprinted by permission of the author.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
All the wintry afternoon we had been
worming our way down the Thames, the big
steamer filtering slowly through the throng
of crafts like a 'bus moving ponderously amid
crowded traffic.  When at last we won free of the river,
the Channel chop took us on its knee and rocked us
roughly, while the skud of wind and rain slapped us
in the face with riotous horse-play.  As we came up
from dinner and struggled aft, our feet slipped and
slithered over the wet decks, and the shouts of the
frozen Lascars at the lookout reached us through
the sopping gloom, despairing as the howls of souls
in torment.  The ugly, hopeless melancholy of our
surroundings accorded well with the mood which
possessed the majority of those on board; for we
were outward bound, and men who leave England
for the good of their purses carry heavy hearts with
them at the start.  In the smoking room, therefore,
with coat-collars tugged up about our ears and
hands thrust deeply into our pockets, we sat
smoking with mournful earnestness, glaring at our
neighbours with the open animosity of the genial Briton.
</p>

<p>
Through the thickening fog of the tobacco-smoke,
the figure of a man seated immediately opposite to
me was dimly visible; but presently his unusual
appearance claimed my closer attention and aroused
my curiosity.  His emaciated body was wrapped in
a huge ulster, from the up-turned collar of which a
head emerged that I can only describe as being like
nothing so much as that of a death's-head moth.
He was clean-shaven, and his cheeks were as hollow
as saucers; his temples were pinched and prominent;
from the bottom of deeply sunken sockets little wild
eyes glared like savage things held fast in a gin.
The mouth was set hard, as though its owner were
enduring agony, and trying his best to repress a
scream.  As much of his hair as his cap and his
coat-collar suffered to be seen was of a dirty
yellow-white; yet in some indefinable way the man did not
give the impression of being old.  Rather he seemed
to be one prematurely broken; one who suffered
acutely and unceasingly; one who, with rigid
self-control, maintained a tight grip upon himself, as
though all his nerves were on edge.  I had marked
a somewhat similar expression of concentrated
determination upon the faces of fellow-passengers
engaged in fighting the demon of sea-sickness; but
this man sucked at his pipe, and obviously drew a
measure of comfort from it, in a fashion which
showed that he was indifferent to the choppy
motion.  Yet though those buried eyes of his were
glaring and savage&mdash;eyes that seemed to be eternally
seeking some means of escape from a haunting
peril&mdash;they were not restless, but rather were fixed
in a venomous scowl; while the man himself, dead
quiet, save for the light that glinted from them,
was apparently sunken in a fathomless abstraction.
All this I noted mechanically, but it was the
extraordinary condition of his face that chiefly excited
my wonder.  It was literally pock-marked with
little purple cicatrices, small oblong lumps, smooth
and shining feebly in the lamplight, that rose above
the surface of the skin, and ran this way and that
at every imaginable angle.  I had seen more than
once the faces of German duellists wonderfully and
fearfully beslashed; but the scars they wore were
long and clean, wholly unlike the badly healed lumps
which disfigured my queer <i>vis-à-vis</i>.  I fell to
speculating as to what could have caused such a
multiplicity of wounds: not a gunpowder explosion,
certainly, for the skin showed none of the blue
tattooing inseparable from injuries so inflicted; nor yet
the bursting of a gun, for that always makes at
least one jagged cut, not innumerable tiny scars
such as those at which I was looking.  I could think
of no solution that would fit the case; and as I
watched, suddenly the man withdrew his hands
from his pockets, waggling them before his face with
a nervous motion as though he were warding off
some invisible assailants.  Then I saw that every
inch of the backs and palms, and as much of his
wrists as were exposed to view, were pitted with
cicatrices similar to those with which his face was
bedecked.
</p>

<p>
"Evening, you folk!" said a nasal voice in the
doorway, breaking discordantly upon the sulky
silence which brooded over us; and I looked up to
see the figure of a typical "down-easter," slim and
alert, standing just within the room.  He had a
keen, hard face on him, like a meat-axe, and the
wet rain stood upon it in drops.  He jerked his
head at us in collective greeting, walked through
the haze of smoke with a free gait and swinging
shoulders, and threw himself down in a heap on the
horse-hair bench beside the man whose strange
appearance had riveted my attention.  Seated thus,
he looked round at us with quick humorous glances,
as though our British solemnity, which made each
one of us grimly isolated in a crowd, struck him as
at once amusing and impossible of endurance.
</p>

<p>
"Snakes!" he exclaimed genially.  "This is
<i>mighty</i> cheerful!"  His strident twang seemed to
cut wedges out of the foggy silence.  "We look as
though we had swallowed a peck of tenpenny nails,
and the blamed things were sitting heavy on our
stomachs.  Come, let us be friendly.  I ain't doing
any trade in sore-headed bears.  Wake up, sonny."  And
he dug his melancholy neighbour in the ribs
with an aggressive and outrageous thumb.
</p>

<p>
It was for all the world as though he had touched
the spring that sets in motion the clockwork of a
mechanical toy.  The man's cap flew from his
head&mdash;disclosing a scalp ill-covered with sparse hairs
and scarred like his face&mdash;as he leaped to his feet
with a scream, torn suddenly, as it were, from the
depths of his self-absorbed abstraction.  Casting
quick nervous glances over his shoulder, he backed
into the nearest corner, his hands clawing at the air,
his eyes hunted, defiant, yet abject.  His whole
figure was instinct with terror&mdash;terror seeking
impotently to defend itself against unnumbered enemies.
His teeth were set, his gums drawn back over them
in two rigid white lines; a sort of snarling cry broke
from him&mdash;a cry that seemed to be the expression
of furious rage, pain, and agonisingly concentrated
effort.
</p>

<p>
It all took place in a fraction of a second&mdash;as
quickly as a man jumps when badly startled&mdash;and
as quickly he recovered his balance, and pulled
himself together.  Then he cast a murderous glance at
the American&mdash;who at that moment presented a
picture of petrified astonishment&mdash;let fly a
venomous oath at him, and slammed out of the room in a
towering rage.
</p>

<p>
"Goramercy!" ejaculated the American limply.
"I want a drink.  Who'll join me?"  But no one
responded to his invitation.
</p>

<p>
That was the occasion of my first meeting with
Timothy O'Hara: but as I subsequently travelled
half across the world in his company, was admitted
to his friendship, and heard him relate his
experiences, not once but many times, I am able to
supply the key to his extraordinary behaviour that
evening.  I regret that it is impossible to give his
story in his own words, for he told it graphically,
and with force; but unfortunately his very proper
indignation got the better of his discretion, with the
result that he frequently waxed blasphemous in the
course of his narrative, and at times was rendered
altogether inarticulate by rage.  However, the
version which I now offer to the reader is accurate in
all essential details: and my own first-hand
knowledge of that gentle race called Muruts, at whose
hands O'Hara fared so evilly, has helped me to fill
in such blanks as may have existed in the tale as it
originally reached me.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
A score of years ago there was a man in North
Borneo, whose name does not matter&mdash;a man who
had the itch of travel in him, and loved untrodden
places for their own sake.  He undertook to explore
the interior of the no-man's-land which the
Chartered Company euphemistically described as its
"property."  He made his way inland from the
western coast, and little more was heard of him for
several months.  At the end of that time a haze of
disquieting rumours, as impalpable as the used-up,
fever-laden wind that blows eternally from the
interior, reached the little squalid stations on the
seashore; and shortly afterward the body of the
explorer, terribly mangled and mutilated, was sluiced
down-country by a freshet, and brought up on a
sand-spit near the mouth of a river on the east
coast.  Here it was discovered by a couple of white
men, who with the aid of a handful of unwilling
natives buried it in becoming state, since it was the
only thing with a European father and mother
which had ever travelled across the centre of North
Borneo, from sea to sea, since the beginning of time.
</p>

<p>
In life the explorer had been noted for his beard,
a great yellow cascade of hair which fell down his
breast from his lip to his waist; and when his corpse
was found this ornament was missing.  The Chartered
Company, whose business it was to pay dividends
in adverse circumstances, did not profess to
be a philanthropical institution, and could not spend
its hard-squeezed revenues upon putting the fear of
death into people who have made too free with the
lives of white folk, as is the practice in other parts
of Asia.  Therefore no steps were taken by the
local administration to punish the Muruts of the
interior who had amused themselves by putting the
explorer to an ugly death; but the knowledge that
the murdered man's beard had been shorn from his
chin by some truculent savage, and was even then
ornamenting the knife-handle of a Murut chief in
the heart of the island rankled in the minds of the
white men on the spot.  The wise and prudent
members of the community talked a great deal, said
roundly that the thing was a shame and an abomination,
and took care to let their discretion carry
them no farther than the spoken word.  The young
and foolish did not say much, but the recovery of
that wisp of hair became to many of them a
tremendous ambition, a dream, something that made
even existence in North Borneo tolerable, while it
presented itself to their imaginations as a feat
possible of accomplishment.  With a few this dream
became an <i>idée fixe</i>, an object in a life that otherwise
was unendurable; and it may even have saved a
few from the perpetration of more immediate
follies.  The quest would be the most hazardous
conceivable, a fitting enterprise for men rendered
desperate by the circumstances into the midst of which
fate had thrust them.
</p>

<p>
Sitting at home in England, with pleasant things
to distract the mind all about you, and with
nothing at hand more dangerous than a taxicab, all this
pother concerning the hairs off a dead man's chin
may appeal to you as something absurdly sentimental
and irrational; but try for the moment to place
yourself in the position of an isolated white man at
an outstation of North Borneo.  Picture to yourself
a tumble-down thatched bungalow standing on a
roughly cleared hill, with four Chinese shops and a
dilapidated police-station squatting on the bank of
a black, creeping river.  Rub in a smudge of
blue-green forest, shutting you up on flanks, front, and
rear.  Fill that forest with scattered huts, wherein
squalid natives live the lives of beasts&mdash;natives
whose language you do not know, whose ideas you
do not understand, who make their presence felt
only by means of savage howls raised by them in
their drunken orgies&mdash;natives whose hatred of you
can only be kept from active expression by such fear
as your armed readiness may inspire.  Add to this
merciless heat, faint exhausted air, an occasional
bout of the black fever of the country, and not
enough of work to preserve your mind from rust.
Remember that the men who are doomed to live in
these places get no sport, have no recreations, no
companionship; and that the long, empty, suffocating
days trail by, one by one, bringing no hope of
change, and that the only communication with the
outer world is kept up fitfully by certain dingy
steam-tramps which are always behind time, and
which may, or may not, arrive once a month.  Can
you wonder that amid such surroundings men wax
melancholy; that they take to brooding over all
manner of trivial things in a fashion which is not
quite sane; and that the knowledge that their
continued existence is dependent upon the wholesome
awe in which white folks are held sometimes gets
upon their nerves, and makes them feverishly
anxious to vindicate the honour of their race?  When
you have let the full meaning of these things sink
into your minds, you will begin to understand why
so much excitement prevailed in North Borneo
concerning the reported ownership of the deceased
explorer's beard.
</p>

<p>
Timothy O'Hara and Harold Bateman had lived
lives such as those which I have described for half
a dozen years or more.  They had had ample leisure
in which to turn the matter of the explorer's beard
over and over in their minds, till the thought of it
had bred something like fanaticism&mdash;a kind of still,
white-hot rage within them.  It chanced that their
leave of absence fell due upon one and the same
day.  It followed that they put their heads together
and decided to start upon a private raid of their own
into the interior of the Murut country, with a view
to redeeming the trophy.  It also followed that they
made their preparations with the utmost secrecy,
and that they enlisted a dozen villainous little
Dyaks from Sarawak to act as their punitive force.
The whole thing was highly improper and very
illegal, but it promised adventurous experiences, and
both Bateman and O'Hara were young and not over-wise.
Also, it must be urged in extenuation of their
conduct that they had the effects of some six years'
crushing monotony to work off; and that they had
learned to regard the Muruts of the interior as their
natural enemies; and that the ugliness and the
deadly solitude of their existence had rendered them
savage, just as the tamest beast becomes wild and
ferocious when it finds itself held in the painful grip
of a trap.
</p>

<p>
I am in nowise concerned to justify their doings:
my part is to record them.  O'Hara and Bateman
vanished one day from the last outpost of
quasi-civilisation, having given out that they were off
up-country in search of big game&mdash;which was a fact.
Their little expedition slipped into the forest, and
the wilderness swallowed it up.  When once they
had pushed out into the unknown interior they were
gone past power of recall, were lost as completely as
a needle in a ten-acre hay-field; and they breathed
more freely because they had escaped from the
narrow zone wherein the law of the white man runs,
and need guide themselves for the future merely by
the dictates of their own rudimentary notions of
right and wrong.
</p>

<p>
They had a very hard time of it, so far as I can
gather; for the current of the rivers, which crept
toward them, black and oily, from the upper
country, was dead against them, and the rapids soon
caused them to abandon their boats.  Then they
tramped it, trudging with dogged perseverance up
and down the hills, clambering painfully up sheer
ascents, slipping down the steep pitches on the other
side, splashing and labouring through the swamps
betwixt hill and hill, or wading waist-deep across
wildernesses of rank <i>lalang</i>-grass, from the green
surface of which the refracted heat smote them
under their hat-brims with the force of blows.
Aching in every limb, half-blinded by the sweat that
trickled into their eyes, flayed by the sun, mired to
the ears in the morasses, torn by thorn-thickets,
devoured by tree-leeches, stung by all manner of
jungle-insects, and oppressed by the weight of
self-imposed effort that pride forbade them to abandon,
they struggled forward persistently, fiercely,
growing more savage and more vindictive at every
painful step.  The golden fleece of beard, which was the
object of their quest, became an oriflamme, in the
wake of which they floundered eternally through
the inferno of an endless fight.  Their determination
to recover it became a madness, a possession: it
filled their minds to the exclusion of aught else,
nerved them to fresh endeavour, spurred them out
of their weariness, and would not suffer them to
rest.  But the bitterness of their travail incensed
them mightily against the Murut folk, whose lack of
reverence for white men had imposed so tremendous
a task upon these self-appointed champions of their
race; and as they sat over their unpalatable meals
when the day's toil was ended, they talked together
in blood-thirsty fashion of the vengeances they
would wreak and the punishment they would exact
from the tribe which was discovered to be in
possession of the object of their search.
</p>

<p>
One feature of their march was that prudence
forbade a halt.  The Murut of North Borneo is a
person of mean understanding, who requires time
wherein to set his slow intellect in motion.  He is a
dipsomaniac, a homicide by training and predilection,
and he has a passion for collecting other people's
skulls, which is an unscrupulous and as fanatical as
that of the modern philatelist.  Whenever he
encounters a stranger, he immediately falls to coveting
that stranger's skull; but as he is a creature of poor
courage it is essential to his comfort that he should
win possession of it only by means that will not
endanger his own skin.  The question as to how
such means may be contrived presents a difficult
problem for his solution, and it takes his groping
mind from two to three days in which to hit upon a
workable plan.  The explorer, as Bateman and
O'Hara were aware, had lost his life because,
overcome by fatigue, he had allowed himself to commit
the mistake of spending more than a single night
under a hospitable Murut roof-tree, and had so
given time to his hosts to plot his destruction.  Had
he only held steadily upon his way, all might have
been well with him: for in a country where every
village is at enmity with its neighbours, a short
march would have carried him into a stranger's
land, which he should have been able to quit in its
turn ere the schemes for his immolation hatched
therein had had time in which to ripen.  O'Hara
and Bateman, therefore, no matter how worn out
they might be by that everlasting, clambering
tramp across that cruel huddle of hill-caps, were
rowelled by necessity into pushing forward, and
still forward, as surely as the day dawned.
</p>

<p>
Often the filth and squalor of the long airless
huts&mdash;each one of which accommodated a whole
village community in its dark interior, all the pigs
and fowls of the place beneath its flooring, and as
many blackened human skulls as could find hanging
space along its roof-beams&mdash;sickened them, and
drove them forth to camp in the jungle.  Here
there were only wild beasts&mdash;self-respecting and
on the whole cleanly beasts, which compared very
favourably with the less attractive animals in the
village huts&mdash;but a vigilant guard had to be
maintained against possible surprise; and this, after a
heart-breaking tramp, was hard alike upon white
men and Dyaks.
</p>

<p>
The raiders had pitched their camp in such a
place one evening; and as the party lacked meat,
and the pigeons could be heard cooing in the
treetops close at hand, O'Hara took his fowling piece
and strolled off alone into the forest, with the
intention of shooting a few birds for the pot.  The
jungle was very dense in this part of the country&mdash;so
dense, indeed, that a man was powerless to see in
any direction for a distance of more than a dozen
yards; but the pigeons were plentiful, and as they
fluttered from tree to tree O'Hara walked after
them without in the least realising how far he was
straying from his starting point.  At last the fast-failing
light arrested his attention, and as he stooped
to pick up the last pigeon, the search for which
among the brambles had occupied more time than
he had fancied, it suddenly struck him that he
ought to be returning to the camp, while a doubt
as to its exact direction assailed him.  He was in
the very act of straightening himself again with a
view to looking about him for some indication of
the path by which he had come when a slight crackle
in the underwood smote upon his ear.  He remained
very still, stooping forward as he was, holding his
breath, and listening intently.  It flashed through
his mind that the sound might have been made by
one of the Dyaks, who perhaps had come out of the
camp in search of him and he waited the repetition
of the snapping noise with eagerness, hoping that it
would tell him whether it were caused by man or
beast.  As he stood thus for an instant with bowed
shoulders, the crackle came again, louder, crisper,
and much clearer than before; and at the same
moment, before he had time to change his attitude
or to realise that danger threatened him, something
smote him heavily in the back, bringing him prone
to the earth with a grunt.  The concussion was
caused by some yielding substance, that was yet
quick and warm; and the litter of dead leaves and
the tangle of underwood combined to break his fall.
He was not hurt, therefore, though the breath was
knocked out of him, and that unseen something,
which tumbled and writhed upon his back, pinned
him to the ground.  He skewed his head round,
trying to see what had assailed him, and immediately
a diabolical face peeped over his shoulder an
inch or two above it.  He only saw, as it were, in a
flash; but the sight was one which, he was
accustomed to say, he would never forget.  In after
years it was wont to recur to him in dreams, and
as surely as it came it woke him with a scream.
It was a savage face, brown yet pallid, grimed with
dirt and wood ashes, with a narrow retreating forehead,
a bestial prognathous snout, and a tiny twitching
chin.  The little black eyes, fierce and excited,
were ringed about with angry sores, for the eyelashes
had been plucked out.  The eyebrows had been
removed, but from the upper lip a few coarse wires
sprouted uncleanly.  The face was split in twain by a
set of uneven teeth pointed like those of a wild cat,
and tightly clenched, while above and below them the
gums snarled rigidly, bearing witness to the physical
effort which their owner was making.  The scalp
was divided into even halves by a broad parting, on
either side of which there rose a tangle of dirty,
ill-kept hair, that was drawn back into a chignon,
giving to the creature a curious sexless aspect.  All
these things O'Hara noted in the fraction of a
second; and as the horror bred of them set him
heaving and fighting as well as his cramped
position made possible, a sharp knee-cap was driven
into the back of his neck, and his head fell with a
concussion that blinded him.  For a moment he
lay still and inert, and in that moment he was
conscious of little deft hands, that flew this way
and that, over, under, and around his limbs, and
of the pressure of narrow withes, drawn suddenly
taut, that ate into his flesh.  Up to this time the
whole affair has been transacted in a dead,
unnatural silence that somehow gave to it the
strangeness and unreality of a nightmare; but now, as
O'Hara lay prostrate with his face buried in the
underwood, the even song of the forest insects,
which rings through the jungle during the gloaming
hour, was suddenly interrupted by an outbreak of
queer sounds&mdash;by gurgling, jerky speech inter-mixed
with shrill squeakings and whistlings, and
by the clicking cackle which stands the Murut folk
instead of laughter.  Yet even now the voices of his
captors were subdued and hushed, as though
unwilling to be overheard; and O'Hara, understanding
that the Muruts feared to be interrupted by their
victim's friends, made shift to raise a shout, albeit
the green stuff forced its way into his mouth and
choked his utterance.
</p>

<p>
Immediately the little nimble hands were busy,
clutching him afresh, while the tones of those
inhuman voices shrilled and gurgled and clicked
more excitedly than before.  O'Hara was heaved
and tugged, first one way, then another, until his
body was rolled over on to its back, falling with a
dull bump.  He shouted once more, putting all the
strength that was in him into the yell, and the
nearest Murut promptly stamped on his mouth
with his horny heel.  O'Hara bit viciously at the
thing, but his teeth could make no impression upon
its leathery under-surface, and before he could shout
again he found himself gagged with a piece of wood,
which was bound in its place by a couple of withes.
Despair seized him then, and for a moment or two
he lay still, with the manhood knocked fairly out
of him by a crushing consciousness of impotence,
while the gabble of squeak and whistle and grunt,
still hushed cautiously, broke out more discordantly
than ever.
</p>

<p>
The withes about his limbs bound O'Hara so
cripplingly that only his neck was free to move;
but presently, craning it upward, he caught sight
of his persecutors for the first time.  They formed
a squalid group of little, half-starved, wizened
creatures, not much larger than most European
children of fourteen, but with brutal faces that
seemed to bear the weight of whole centuries of
care and animal indulgence.  They were naked,
save for their foul loin-clouts; they were abominably
dirty, and their skins were smothered in leprous-looking
ringworm; they had not an eyelash or an
eyebrow among them, for the hairs had been plucked
out by the root; but their scalps were covered by
frowsy growths, gathered into loathsome chignons
on the napes of their necks.  Every man was armed
with one or more spears, and from the waist of
each a long knife depended, sheathed in a wooden
scabbard hung with tufts of hair.  One of them&mdash;the
man of whose face O'Hara had caught a glimpse
above his shoulder&mdash;flourished his sheathed knife
insistently in his captive's face with grotesque
gesticulations, and O'Hara shuddered every time
that the disgusting tassels that bedecked the
scabbard swept his cheek.  The fading daylight was
very dim now, enabling O'Hara to see only the
<i>form</i> of the things by which he was surrounded;
<i>colour</i> had ceased to have any meaning in those
gloomy forest aisles.  The grinning savage prancing
and gibbering around him, and brandishing that
sheathed weapon with its revolting trophies, puzzled
him.  If he meant murder, why did he not draw his
blade?  In the depth of his misery the inconsequence
of this war-dance furnished O'Hara with an
additional torture.
</p>

<p>
Presently two of the Muruts came suddenly
within his field of vision bearing a long green pole.
This they proceeded to thrust between O'Hara's
flesh and the withes that were entwined about him;
and when this had been accomplished, the whole
party set their shoulders under the extremities of
the pole and lifted their prisoner clear of the ground.
Then they bore him off at a sort of jog-trot.
</p>

<p>
The thongs, tightened fearfully by the pressure
thus put upon them, pinched and bruised him pitilessly;
and his head, lacking all support, hung down
in an attitude of dislocation, waggling this way and
that at every jolt; the blood surged into his brain,
causing a horrible vertigo, and seeming to thrust his
eyes almost out of their sockets; he thought that he
could feel his limbs swelling above the biting grip of
the withes, and an irresistible nausea seized him.
Maddening cramps tied knots in his every muscle;
and had his journey been of long duration, Timothy
O'Hara would never have reached its end alive.
Very soon, however, the decreased pace, and the
shrill whistling sounds which came from the noses
of his Murut bearers, told him that the party was
ascending a hill&mdash;for these strange folk do not pant
like ordinary human beings, and the uncanny noise
was familiar to O'Hara from many a toilsome march
in the company of native porters.  Presently, too,
between the straining legs of the leading files, O'Hara
caught a flying glimpse of distant fire; and that, he
knew, betokened the neighbourhood of a village.
</p>

<p>
A few minutes later, just as he thought that he was
about to lose consciousness, the village was reached&mdash;a
long, narrow hut, raised on piles, and with a door
at either end, from the thresholds of which crazy
ladder-ways led to the ground.  Up the nearest of
these rude staircases the Muruts struggled with their
burden, banging his head roughly against each
untrimmed rung, and throwing him down on the
bamboo flooring with a chorus of grunts.  For a moment
there was silence, while the entire community
gathered round the white man, staring at him eagerly
with a kind of ferocious curiosity.  Then with one
accord all the men, women, and children present set
up a diabolical chorus of whoopings and yellings.
They seemed to give themselves over to a veritable
insanity of noise.  Some, squatting on their heels,
supporting the weight of their bodies on arms
thrust well behind them, tilted their chins to the
roof and howled like maniacs.  Others, standing
erect, opened their mouths to their fullest extent,
and emitted a series of shrill blood-curdling bellows.
Others, again, shut their eyes, threw their arms
aloft, and, concentrating every available atom of
energy in the effort, screamed till their voices broke.
The ear-piercing din sounded as though all the
devils in hell had of a sudden broken loose.  Heard
from afar, the savage triumph, the diabolical delight
that found in it their fitting expression, might well
have made the blood run cold in the veins of the
bravest; but heard close at hand by the solitary
white man whose capture had evoked that hideous
outcry, and who knew himself to be utterly at the
mercy of these fiends, it was almost enough to
unship his reason.  O'Hara told me that from that
moment he forgot the pains which his bonds had
occasioned him, forgot even his desire to escape, and
was filled with a tremendous longing to be put out
of his agony&mdash;to be set free by death from this
unspeakable inferno.  His mind, he said, was working
with surprising activity, and "as though it belonged
to somebody else."  In a series of flashes he began
to recall all that he had ever heard of the manners
and customs of the Muruts, of the strange uses to
which they put their prisoners; and all the while he
was possessed by a kind of restlessness that made him
eager for them to do <i>something</i>&mdash;of no matter how
awful a character&mdash;that would put a period to his
unendurable suspense.
</p>

<p>
Meanwhile the Muruts were enjoying themselves
thoroughly.  Great earthenware jars, each
sufficiently large to drown a baby with comfort, were
already standing round the enclosed veranda
which formed the common-room of the village, on
to which each family cubicle opened, and to these
jars the Muruts&mdash;men, women, and children&mdash;repeatedly
addressed themselves, squatting by them,
and sucking up the abominable liquor which filled
them through long bamboo tubes.  Each toper, as
he quitted the jar, fell to howling with redoubled
energy; and as more and more of the fiery stuff was
consumed, their cries became more savage, more
inarticulate, and more diabolical.
</p>

<p>
Half a dozen men, however, were apparently busy
in the performance of some task on a spot just behind
O'Hara's head, for though they frequently paid
visits of ceremony to the liquor-jars, they always
staggered back to the same part of the room when
their draughts were ended, and there fell to hacking
and hammering at wood with renewed energy.
O'Hara was convinced that they were employed in
constructing some infernal instrument of torture;
and the impossibility of ascertaining its nature was
maddening, and set his imagination picturing every
abominable contrivance for the infliction of anguish
of which he had ever heard or read.  And all the
while the hideous orgies, for which his capture was
the pretext, were waxing fast and furious.
</p>

<p>
Suddenly the hidden group behind him set up a
shrill cat-call, and at the sound every Murut in sight
leaped to his or her feet, and danced frantically with
hideous outcry and maniacal laughter.  A moment
later a rattan rope whined as it was pulled over the
main beam of the roof with something heavy at its
end; and as the slack of the cord was made fast to
the wall-post opposite to him, O'Hara was aware of
some large object suspended in mid-air, swinging out
into the middle of the veranda immediately above
him.  This, as he craned his neck up at it, struggling
to see it more clearly in the uncertain torch-light,
was presently revealed as a big cage, an uneven
square in shape, the bars of which were some six
inches apart, saving on one side, where a wide gap
was left.  He had barely had time to make this
discovery when a mob of Murut men and women
rushed at him, cut the bonds that bound him, and
mauling him mercilessly, lifted him up, and literally
threw him into the opening formed by the gap.  The
cage rocked crazily, while the Muruts yelled their
delight, and two of their number proceeded hastily
to patch up the gap with cross-pieces of wood.  Then
the whole crowd drew away a little, though the
hub-bub never slackened, and O'Hara set his teeth to
smother the groans which the pains of the removed
bonds nearly wrung from him.  For the time fear was
forgotten in the acuteness of the agony which he
endured; for as the blood began to flow freely once
more, every inch of his body seemed to have been
transformed into so many raging teeth.  His
extremities felt soft and flabby&mdash;cold, too, like
jellies&mdash;but O'Hara was by nature a very strong man and
at the time of his capture had been in the pink of
condition.  In an incredibly short while, therefore,
the pain subsided, and he began to regain the use of
his cramped limbs.
</p>

<p>
He was first made aware of his recovered activity
by the alacrity with which he bounded into the
centre of the cage in obedience to a sharp prick in the
back.  He tried to rise to his feet, and his head came
into stunning contact with the roof; then, in a
crouching attitude, he turned in the direction whence
the attack had reached him.  What he saw filled
him with horror.  The leader of the Muruts who had
captured him, his eyes bloodshot with drink, was
staggering about in front of him with grotesque
posturings, waving his knife in one hand and its
wooden sheath in the other.  It was the former,
evidently, that had administered that painful prod to
O'Hara's back, but it was the latter which chained
the white man's attention even in that moment of
whirling emotions, for from its base depended a long
shaggy wisp of sodden yellow hair&mdash;the golden fleece
of which O'Hara and Bateman were in search.  In
a flash the savage saw that his victim had
recognised the trophy to which he had already been at
some pains to direct to his attention, and the
assembled Muruts gave unmistakable tokens that they all
grasped the picturesqueness of the situation.  They
yelled and howled and bayed more frantically than
ever; some of them rolled upon the floor, their
limbs and faces contorted by paroxysms of savage
merriment, while others staggered about, smiting
their fellows on their bare shoulders, squeaking like
bats, and clicking like demoralised clockwork.  A
second prod with a sharp point made O'Hara shy
across his narrow cage like a fly-bitten horse, and
before he could recover his balance a score of
delicately handled weapons inflicted light wounds all
over his face and hands.  As each knife touched him
its owner put up his head and repeated some formula
in a shrill sing-song, no word of which was
intelligible to O'Hara save only the name of Kina-Balu&mdash;the
great mountain which dominates North Borneo,
and is believed by the natives to be the eternal
resting-place of the spirits which have quitted the life
of earth.
</p>

<p>
Then, for the first time, O'Hara understood what
was happening to him.  He had often heard of the
ceremony known to the wild Muruts as a <i>bangun</i>,
which has for its object the maintenance of communication
between the living and the dead.  He had even
seen a pig hung up, as he was now hanging, while the
tamer Muruts prodded it to death very carefully
and slowly, charging it the while with messages for
the spirits of the departed; and he remembered
how the abominable cruelty of the proceeding had
turned him sick, and had set him longing to interfere
with native religious customs in defiance of the
prudent government which he served.  Now he was
himself to be done to death by inches, just as the
pig had died, and he knew that men had spoken
truly when they had explained to him that the
unfortunate quadruped was only substituted for a
nobler victim as a concession to European prejudice,
to the great discontent of the tame Muruts.
</p>

<p>
These thoughts rushed through his mind with the
speed of lightning, and all the while it seemed to him
that every particle of his mental forces was
concentrated upon a single object&mdash;the task of defending
himself against a crowd of persecutors.  Crouching
in the centre of the cage, snarling like a cat, with his
eyes bursting from their sockets, his every limb
braced for a leap in any direction, his hands scrabbling
at the air to ward off the stabs, he faced from
side to side, his breath coming in quick, noisy pants.
Every second one or another of the points that
assailed him made him turn about with a cry of rage,
and immediately his exposed back was prodded by
every Murut within reach.  Suddenly he heard his
own voice raised in awful curses and blasphemies,
and the familiar tones of his mother-tongue smote
him with surprise.  He had little consciousness of
pain as pain, only the necessity of warding off the
points of his enemies' weapons presented itself to
him as something that must be accomplished at all
costs, and each separate failure enraged him.  He
bounded about his cage with an energy and an
agility that astonished him, and the rocking of his
prison seemed to keep time with the lilting of his
thumping heart-beats.  More than once he fell, and
his face and scalp were prodded terribly ere he could
regain his feet; often he warded off a thrust with
his bare hands.  But of the wounds which he thus
received he was hardly conscious; his mind was in a
species of delirium of rage, and all the time he was
torn with a fury of indignation because he, a white
man, was being treated in this dishonouring fashion
by a pack of despicable Muruts.  But he received no
serious injury; for the Muruts, who had many
messages for their dead relations, were anxious to
keep the life in him as long as might be, and in spite
of their intoxication, prodded him with shrewdness
and caution.  How long it all lasted O'Hara never
knew with certainty; but it was the exhaustion
caused by loss of breath and blood, and by the wild
leaping of that bursting heart of his, that caused
him presently to sink on the floor of his cage in a
swoon.
</p>

<p>
The Muruts, finding that he did not answer to
their stabs, drew off and gathered eagerly around
the liquor-jars.  The killing would come soon after
dawn&mdash;as soon, in fact, as their overnight orgies
made it possible&mdash;when the prisoner would be set to
run the gauntlet, and would be hacked to pieces after
one final delicious <i>bangun</i>.  It was essential, therefore,
that enough strength should be left in him to
show good sport; and in the meantime their villainous
home-made spirits would bring that measure
of happiness which comes to the Murut from being
suffered, for a little space, to forget the fact of his
own repulsive existence.  Accordingly, with noisy
hospitality, each man tried to make his neighbour
drink to greater excess than himself, and all proved
willing victims.  With hoots and squeals of laughter,
little children were torn from their mothers' breasts
and given to suck at the bamboo pipes, their ensuing
intoxication being watched with huge merriment by
men and women alike.  The shouts raised by the
revellers became more and more shaky, less and less
articulate; over and over again the groups around
the jars broke up, while their members crawled away,
to lie about in deathlike stupors, from which they
aroused themselves only to vomit and drink anew.
</p>

<p>
Long after this stage of the proceedings had been
reached, O'Hara had recovered his senses; but
prudence bade him lie as still as a mouse.  Once or
twice a drunken Murut lurched onto his feet and
made a pass or two at him, and now and again he
was prodded painfully; but putting forth all the
self-control at his command, he gave no sign of life.  At
last every Murut in the place was sunken in abominable
torpor, excepting only the chief, from whose
knife-scabbard hung the tuft of hair which had once
ornamented the chin of the explorer.  His little red
eyes were fixed in a drunken stare upon O'Hara, and
the latter watched them with a fascination of dread
through his half-closed lids.  Over and over again
the Murut crawled to the nearest liquor-jar, and
sucked up the dregs with a horrible sibilant gurgling;
and at times he even staggered to his feet, muttering
and mumbling over his tiny, busy chin, waving his
weapon uncertainly, ere he subsided in a limp heap
upon the floor.  On each occasion he gave more
evident signs of drowsiness and at last his blinking
eyes were covered by their lashless lids.
</p>

<p>
At the same moment a gentle gnawing sound,
which had been attracting O'Hara's attention for
some minutes, though he had not dared to move by
so much as a finger's breadth to discover its cause,
ceased abruptly.  Then the faintest ghost of a
whisper came to his ears from below his cage, and,
moving with the greatest caution, and peering down
through the uncertain light, he saw that a hole had
been made by sawing away two of the lathes which
formed the flooring.  In the black hole immediately
beneath him the faces of two of his own Dyaks were
framed, and even as he looked one of them hoisted
himself into the hut, and began deftly to remove the
bars of the cage, working as noiselessly as a shadow.
The whole thing was done so silently, and O'Hara's
own mind was so racked by the emotions which his
recent experiences had held for him, that he was at
first persuaded that what he saw, or rather fancied
he saw, was merely a figment conjured up for his
torture by the delirium which possessed him.  He
felt that if he suffered himself to believe in this
mocking delusion even for an instant, the disappointment
of discovering its utter unreality would drive him
mad.  He was already spent with misery, physical
and mental; he was constantly holding himself in
leash to prevent the commission of some insane
extravagance; he was seized with an unreasoning
desire to scream.  He fought with himself&mdash;a self
that was unfamiliar to him, although its identity
was never in doubt&mdash;as he might have fought with
a stranger.  He told himself that his senses were
playing cruel pranks upon him, and that nothing
should induce him to be deceived by them; and all
the while&mdash;hope&mdash;mad, wild hysterical hope&mdash;was
surging up in his heart, shaking him like an aspen,
wringing unaccustomed tears from his eyes, and
tearing his breast with noiseless sobs.
</p>

<p>
As he lay inert and utterly wretched, unable to
bear up manfully under this new wanton torture
of the mind, the ghost of the second Dyak clambered
skilfully out of the darkness below the hut,
and joined his fellow, who had already made a wide
gap in the side of the cage.  Then the two of them
seized O'Hara, and with the same strange absence
of sound lifted him bodily through the prison and
through the hole in the flooring on to the earth
below.  Their grip upon his lacerated flesh hurt
him acutely; but the very pain was welcome, for
did it not prove the reality of his deliverers?  What
he experienced of relief and gratitude O'Hara could
never tell us, for all he remembers is that, gone
suddenly weak and plaintive as a child, he clung
to the little Dyaks, sobbing broken-heartedly, and
weeping on their shoulders without restraint or
decency, in utter abandon of self-pity.  Also he
recalls dimly that centuries later he found himself
standing in Bateman's camp, with his people
gathering about him, and that of a sudden he was aware
that he was mother-naked.  After that, so he
avers, all is a blank.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
The closing incidents of the story were related
to me by Bateman one evening when I chanced to
foregather with him in an up-country outpost in
Borneo.  We had been talking far into the night,
and our <i>solitude à deux</i> and the lateness of the hour
combined to thaw his usual taciturnity and to
unlock his shy confidence.  Therefore I was put
in possession of a secret which until then, I believe,
had been closely kept.
</p>

<p>
"It was an awful night," he said, "that upon
which poor O'Hara was missing.  The Dyaks had
gone out in couples all over the place to try to pick
up his trail, but I remained in the camp; for though
there was a little moon, it was too dark for a white
man's eyes to be of any good.  What with the
inactivity, and my fears for O'Hara, I was as 'jumpy'
as you make 'em; and as the Dyaks began to drop
in, two at a time, each couple bringing in their tale
of failure, I worked myself up to such a state of
depression and misery that I thought I must be
going mad.  Just about three o'clock in the morning
the last brace of Dyaks turned up, and I was all of a
shake when I saw that they had poor O'Hara with
them.  He broke loose from them and stumbled into
the centre of the camp stark naked, and pecked almost
to bits by those infernal Murut knives; but the
wounds were not overdeep, and the blood was
caking over most of them.  He was an awful sight,
and I was for tending his hurt without delay; but he
pushed me roughly aside, and I saw that his eyes
were blazing with madness.  He stood there in the
midst of us all, throwing his arms above his head,
cursing in English and in the vernacular, and
gesticulating wildly.  The Dyaks edged away from him,
and I could see that his condition funked them
mortally.  I tried again and again to speak to him
and calm him, but he would not listen to a word I
said, and for full five minutes he stood there raving
and ranting, now and again pacing frenziedly from
side to side, pouring out a torrent of invective mixed
with muddled orders.  One of the Dyaks brought
him a pair of trousers, and after looking at them as
though he had never seen such things before, he put
them on, and stood for a second or two staring
wildly around him.  Then he made a bee-line for a
rifle, loaded it, and slung a bandolier across his
naked shoulders; and before I could stay him he was
marching out of the camp with the whole crowd of
Dyaks at his heels.
</p>

<p>
"I could only follow.  I had no fancy for being
left alone in that wilderness, more especially just
then, and one of the Dyaks told me that he was
leading them back to the Murut village.  You see
I only speak Malay, and as O'Hara had been talking
Dyak I had not been able to follow his ravings.
Whatever lingo he jabbered, however, it was as
plain as a pikestaff that the fellow was mad as a
hatter; but I had to stop explaining this to him,
for he threatened to shoot me, and the Dyaks would
not listen.  They clearly thought that he was
possessed by a devil, and they would have gone to
hell at his bidding while their fear of him was upon
them.
</p>

<p>
"And his madness made him cunning too, for he
stalked the Murut den wonderfully neatly, and just
as the dawn was breaking we found ourselves posted
in the jungle within a few yards of the two doors,
which were the only means of entrance or exit for
the poor devils in the hut.
</p>

<p>
"Then O'Hara leaped out of his hiding place and
began yelling like the maniac he was; and in an
instant the whole of that long hut was humming
like a disturbed beehive.  Three or four squalid
creatures showed themselves at the doorway nearest
O'Hara, and he greeted them with half the contents
of his magazine, and shrieked with laughter as they
toppled onto the ground rolling over in their
death-agony.  There was such a wailing and crying set up
by the other inhabitants of the hut as you never
heard in all your life&mdash;it was just despair made
vocal&mdash;the sort of outcry that a huge menagerie of
wild animals might make when they saw flames
lapping at their cages; and above it all I could hear
O'Hara's demoniac laughter ringing with savage
delight, and the war-whoops of those little devils of
Dyaks, whose blood was fairly up now.  The trapped
wretches in the hut made a stampede for the farther
door; we could hear them scuffling and fighting
with one another for the foremost places.  They
thought that safety lay in that direction; but the
Dyaks were ready for them, and the bullets from
their Winchesters drove clean through three and
four of the squirming creatures at a time, and in a
moment that doorway, too, and the ground about
the ladder foot were a shambles.
</p>

<p>
"After that for a space there was a kind of awful
lull within the hut, though without O'Hara and his
Dyaks capered and yelled.  Then the noise which
our folk were making was drowned by a series of
the most heart-breaking shrieks you ever heard or
dreamed of, and immediately a second rush was
made simultaneously at each door.  The early
morning light was getting stronger now, and I
remember noting how incongruously peaceful and
serene it seemed.  Part of the hut near our end had
caught fire somehow, and there was a lot of smoke,
which hung low about the doorway.  Through
this I saw the crowd of Muruts struggle in that
final rush, and my blood went cold when I understood
what they were doing.  Every man had a
woman or a child held tightly in his arms&mdash;held in
front of him as a buckler&mdash;and it was from these poor
devils that those awful screams were coming.  I
jumped in front of the Dyaks and yelled to them in
Malay to hold their fire; but O'Hara thrust me
aside, and shooed the Dyaks on with shouts and
curses and peals of laughter, slapping his palm on
his gunstock, and capering with delight and excitement.
The Dyaks took no sort of heed of me, and
the volleys met the Muruts like a wall of lead.
</p>

<p>
"I had slipped and fallen when O'Hara pushed
me, and as I clambered on to my feet again I saw
the mob of savages fall together and crumple up,
for all the world as paper crumples when burned
suddenly.  Most of them fell back into the dark
interior of the hut, writhing in convulsions above the
litter of the dead; but one or two pitched forward
headlong to the ground, and I saw a little brown
baby, which had escaped unharmed, crawling about
over the corpses, and squeaking like a wounded
rabbit.  I ran forward to save it, but a Dyak was
too quick for me, and before I could get near it, he
had thrown himself upon it, and ... <i>ugh</i>!
</p>

<p>
"The Muruts began cutting their way through
the flooring then, and trying to bolt into the jungle.
One or two of them got away, I think; and this
threw O'Hara into such a passion of fury that I
half expected to see him kill some of the Dyaks.
He tore around to the side of the hut, and I saw him
brain one Murut as he made a rush from under the
low floor.  One end of the building was in roaring
flames by this time, and half a dozen Dyaks had
gone in at the other end and were bolting the
wretched creatures from their hiding places, just as
ferrets bolt rabbits from their burrows, while O'Hara
and the other Dyaks waited for them outside.
They hardly missed one of them, sparing neither
age nor sex, though I ran from one to another like a
madman, trying to prevent them.  It was awful
... awful! and I was fairly blubbering with the
horror of it, and with the consciousness of my own
impotence.  I was regularly broken up by it, and I
remember at the last sitting down upon a log,
burying my face in my hands, and crying like a child.
</p>

<p>
"The thing seemed to be over by then: there was
no more bolting, and the Dyaks were beginning to
clear out of the hut as the flames gained ground
and made the place too hot for them.  But, at the
last, there came a terrific yell from the very heart of
the fire, and a single Murut leaped out of the smoke.
He was stark naked, for his loin clout had been
burned to tinder; he was blackened by the smoke,
and his long hair was afire behind him!  His mouth
was wide, and the cries that came from it went
through and through my head, running up and up
the scale till they hit upon a note the shrillness of
which agonised me.  Surrounded by the flames, he
looked like a devil in the heart of the pit.  In one
scorched arm he brandished a long knife, the blade
of which was red with the glare of the flames, and in
the other was the sheath, blazing at one end, and
decked at the other by a great tuft of yellow hair
that was smouldering damply.
</p>

<p>
"As soon as he saw him O'Hara raised a terrible
cry and threw himself at him.  The two men grappled
and fell, the knife and scabbard escaping from the
Murut's grasp and pitching straight into the fire.
The struggle lasted for nearly a minute, O'Hara and
his enemy rolling over and over one another,
breathing heavily but making no other sound.  Then
something happened&mdash;I don't clearly know what;
but the Murut's head dropped, and O'Hara rose up
from his dead body, moving very stiffly.  He stood
for a moment so, looking round him in a dazed
fashion, until his eyes caught mine.  Then he
staggered toward me, reeling like a tipsy man.
</p>

<p>
"'Mother of heaven!' he said thickly, 'what
have I done?'
</p>

<p>
"He stared round him at the little brown corpses,
doubled up in dislocated and distorted attitudes,
and his eyes were troubled.
</p>

<p>
"'God forgive me!' he muttered.  'God forgive
me!'
</p>

<p>
"Then he spun about on his heel, his hands
outstretched above his head, his fingers clutching at the
air, a thin foam forming on his lips, and before I
could reach him he had toppled over in a limp heap
upon the ground.
</p>

<p>
"I had an awful business getting O'Hara
down-country.  He was mad as a March hare for three
weeks.  But the Dyaks worked like bricks&mdash;though
I could not bear the sight of them&mdash;and the
currents of the rivers were in our favour when we
reached navigable water.  I know that O'Hara was
mad that morning&mdash;no white man could have acted
as he did unless he had been insane&mdash;and he always
swears that he has no recollection of anything that
occurred after the Dyaks rescued him.  I hope it
may be so, but I am not certain.  He is a changed
man anyway, as nervous and jumpy as they make
'em, and I know that he is always brooding over
that up-country trip of ours."
</p>

<p>
"Yes," I assented, "and he is constantly telling
the first part of the story to every chance soul he
meets."
</p>

<p>
"Exactly," said Bateman.  "That is what makes
me sometimes doubt the completeness of his oblivion
concerning what followed.  What do you think?"

<br /><br />
LEGEND OF COUNT JULIAN AND HIS FAMILY
</h3>

<p class="t3">
WASHINGTON IRVING
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
Many and various are the accounts given in
ancient chronicles of the fortunes of Count
Julian and his family, and many are the
traditions on the subject still extant among the
populace of Spain, and perpetuated in those
countless ballads sung by peasants and muleteers, which
spread a singular charm over the whole of this
romantic land.
</p>

<p>
He who has travelled in Spain in the true way in
which the country ought to be travelled,&mdash;sojourning
in its remote provinces, rambling among the
rugged defiles and secluded valleys of its mountains,
and making himself familiar with the people in their
out-of-the-way hamlets and rarely visited
neighbourhoods,&mdash;will remember many a group of
travellers and muleteers, gathered of an evening around
the door or the spacious hearth of a mountain venta,
wrapped in their brown cloaks, and listening with
grave and profound attention to the long historic
ballad of some rustic troubadour, either recited with
the true <i>ore rotunda</i> and modulated cadences of
Spanish elocution, or chanted to the tinkling of a
guitar.  In this way he may have heard the doleful
end of Count Julian and his family recounted in
traditionary rhymes, that have been handed down
from generation to generation.  The particulars,
however, of the following wild legend are chiefly
gathered from the writings of the pseudo Moor
Rasis; how far they may be safely taken as historic
facts it is impossible now to ascertain; we must
content ourselves, therefore, with their answering to the
exactions of poetic justice.
</p>

<p>
... Everything had prospered with Count
Julian.  He had gratified his vengeance; he had
been successful in his treason, and had acquired
countless riches from the ruin of his country.  But
it is not outward success that constitutes prosperity.
The tree flourishes with fruit and foliage while
blasted and withering at the heart.  Wherever he went,
Count Julian read hatred in every eye.  The Christians
cursed him as the cause of all their woe; the
Moslems despised and distrusted him as a traitor.
Men whispered together as he approached, and then
turned away in scorn; and mothers snatched away
their children with horror if he offered to caress
them.  He withered under the execration of his
fellow-men, and last, and worst of all, he began to
loathe himself.  He tried in vain to persuade
himself that he had but taken a justifiable vengeance;
he felt that no personal wrong can justify the crime
of treason to one's country.
</p>

<p>
For a time he sought in luxurious indulgence to
soothe or forget the miseries of the mind.  He
assembled round him every pleasure and gratification
that boundless wealth could purchase, but all in
vain.  He had no relish for the dainties of his
board; music had no charm wherewith to lull his
soul, and remorse drove slumber from his pillow.
He sent to Ceuta for his wife Frandina, his
daughter Florinda, and his youthful son Alarbot; hoping
in the bosom of his family to find that sympathy
and kindness which he could no longer meet with in
the world.  Their presence, however, brought him
no alleviation.  Florinda, the daughter of his heart,
for whose sake he had undertaken this signal
vengeance, was sinking a victim to its effects.
Wherever she went, she found herself a byword of shame
and reproach.  The outrage she had suffered was
imputed to her as wantonness, and her calamity was
magnified into a crime.  The Christians never
mentioned her name without a curse, and the Moslems,
the gainers by her misfortune, spake of her only by
the appellation of Cava, the vilest epithet they could
apply to woman.
</p>

<p>
But the opprobrium of the world was nothing to
the upbraiding of her own heart.  She charged
herself with all the miseries of these disastrous
wars,&mdash;the deaths of so many gallant cavaliers, the
conquest and perdition of her country.  The anguish of
her mind preyed upon the beauty of her person.
Her eye, once soft and tender in its expression,
became wild and haggard; her cheek lost its bloom,
and became hollow and pallid, and at times there
was desperation in her words.  When her father
sought to embrace her she withdrew with shuddering
from his arms, for she thought of his treason
and the ruin it had brought upon Spain.  Her
wretchedness increased after her return to her native
country, until it rose to a degree of frenzy.  One
day when she was walking with her parents in the
garden of their palace, she entered a tower, and,
having barred the door, ascended to the battlements.
From thence she called to them in piercing
accents, expressive of her insupportable anguish and
desperate determination.  "Let this city," said she,
"be henceforth called Malacca, in memorial of the
most wretched of women, who therein put an end
to her days."  So saying, she threw herself
headlong from the tower and was dashed to pieces.  The
city, adds the ancient chronicler, received the name
thus given it, though afterwards softened to Malaga,
which it still retains in memory of the tragical
end of Florinda.
</p>

<p>
The Countess Frandina abandoned this scene of
woe, and returned to Ceuta, accompanied by her
infant son.  She took with her the remains of her
unfortunate daughter, and gave them honourable
sepulture in a mausoleum of the chapel belonging to
the citadel.  Count Julian departed for Carthagena,
where he remained plunged in horror at this doleful
event.
</p>

<p>
About this time, the cruel Suleiman, having
destroyed the family of Muza, had sent an Arab
general, named Alahor, to succeed Abdalasis as emir or
governor of Spain.  The new emir was of a cruel
and suspicious nature, and commenced his sway
with a stern severity that soon made those under
his command look back with regret to the easy rule
of Abdalasis.  He regarded with an eye of distrust
the renegade Christians who had aided in the
conquest, and who bore arms in the service of the
Moslems; but his deepest suspicions fell upon Count
Julian.  "He has been a traitor to his own country-men,"
said he; "how can we be sure that he will
not prove traitor to us?"
</p>

<p>
A sudden insurrection of the Christians who had
taken refuge in the Asturian Mountains quickened
his suspicions, and inspired him with fears of some
dangerous conspiracy against his power.  In the
height of his anxiety, he bethought him of an
Arabian sage named Yuza, who had accompanied him
from Africa.  This son of science was withered in
form, and looked as if he had outlived the usual
term of mortal life.  In the course of his studies and
travels in the East, he had collected the knowledge
and experience of ages; being skilled in astrology,
and, it is said, in necromancy, and possessing the
marvellous gift of prophecy or divination.  To this
expounder of mysteries Alahor applied to learn
whether any secret treason menaced his safety.
</p>

<p>
The astrologer listened with deep attention and
overwhelming brow to all the surmises and suspicions
of the emir, then shut himself up to consult
his books and commune with those supernatural
intelligences subservient to his wisdom.  At an
appointed hour the emir sought him in his cell.  It was
filled with the smoke of perfumes; squares and circles
and various diagrams were described upon the floor,
and the astrologer was poring over a scroll of parchment,
covered with cabalistic characters.  He received
Alahor with a gloomy and sinister aspect; pretending
to have discovered fearful portents in the heavens,
and to have had strange dreams and mystic visions.
</p>

<p>
"O emir," said he, "be on your guard! treason is
around you and in your path; your life is in peril.
Beware of Count Julian and his family."
</p>

<p>
"Enough," said the emir.  "They shall all die!
Parents and children.&mdash;all shall die!"
</p>

<p>
He forthwith sent a summons to Count Julian to
attend him in Cordova.  The messenger found him
plunged in affliction for the recent death of his
daughter.  The count excused himself, on account
of this misfortune, from obeying the commands of
the emir in person, but sent several of his adherents.
His hesitation, and the circumstance of his having
sent his family across the straits to Africa, were
construed by the jealous mind of the emir into
proofs of guilt.  He no longer doubted his being
concerned in the recent insurrections, and that he
had sent his family away, preparatory to an
attempt, by force of arms, to subvert the Moslem
domination.  In his fury he put to death Siseburto
and Evan, the nephews of Bishop Oppas and sons
of the former king, Witiza, suspecting them of
taking part in the treason.  Thus did they expiate their
treachery to their country in the fatal battle of the
Guadalete.
</p>

<p>
Alahor next hastened to Carthagena to seize upon
Count Julian.  So rapid were his movements that
the count had barely time to escape with fifteen
cavaliers, with whom he took refuge in the strong
castle of Marcuello, among the mountains of
Aragon.  The emir, enraged to be disappointed of his
prey, embarked at Carthagena and crossed the
straits to Ceuta, to make captives of the Countess
Frandina and her son.
</p>

<p>
The old chronicle from which we take this part of
our legend presents a gloomy picture of the countess
in the stern fortress to which she had fled for
refuge,&mdash;a picture heightened by supernatural
horrors.  These latter the sagacious reader will admit
or reject according to the measure of his faith and
judgment; always remembering that in dark and
eventful times, like those in question, involving the
destinies of nations, the downfall of kingdoms, and
the crimes of rulers and mighty men, the hand of
fate is sometimes strangely visible, and confounds
the wisdom of the worldly wise, by intimations and
portents above the ordinary course of things.  With
this proviso, we make no scruple to follow the
venerable chronicler in his narration.
</p>

<p>
Now it so happened that the Countess Frandina
was seated late at night in her chamber in the citadel
of Ceuta, which stands on a lofty rock, overlooking
the sea.  She was revolving in gloomy thought
the late disasters of her family, when she heard a
mournful noise like that of the sea-breeze moaning
about the castle walls.  Raising her eyes, she beheld
her brother, the Bishop Oppas, at the entrance of
the chamber.  She advanced to embrace him, but
he forbade her with a motion of his hand, and she
observed that he was ghastly pale, and that his eyes
glared as with lambent flames.
</p>

<p>
"Touch me not, sister," said he, with a mournful
voice, "lest thou be consumed by the fire which
rages within me.  Guard well thy son, for
bloodhounds are upon his track.  His innocence might
have secured him the protection of Heaven, but our
crimes have involved him in our common ruin."  He
ceased to speak and was no longer to be seen.  His
coming and going were alike without noise, and the
door of the chamber remained fast bolted.
</p>

<p>
On the following morning a messenger arrived
with tidings that the Bishop Oppas had been made
prisoner in battle by the insurgent Christians of the
Asturias, and had died in fetters in a tower of the
mountains.  The same messenger brought word that
the Emir Alahor had put to death several of the
friends of Count Julian; had obliged him to fly for
his life to a castle in Aragon, and was embarking
with a formidable force for Ceuta.
</p>

<p>
The Countess Frandina, as has already been
shown, was of courageous heart, and danger made
her desperate.  There were fifty Moorish soldiers
in the garrison; she feared that they would prove
treacherous, and take part with their countrymen.
Summoning her officers, therefore, she informed
them of their danger, and commanded them to put
those Moors to death.  The guards sallied forth to
obey her orders.  Thirty-five of the Moors were in
the great square, unsuspicious of any danger, when
they were severally singled out by their executioners,
and, at a concerted signal, killed on the spot.  The
remaining fifteen took refuge in a tower.  They
saw the armada of the emir at a distance, and hoped
to be able to hold out until its arrival.  The soldiers
of the countess saw it also, and made extraordinary
efforts to destroy these internal enemies before they
should be attacked from without.  They made
repeated attempts to storm the tower, but were as
often repulsed with severe loss.  They then undermined
it, supporting its foundations by stanchions
of wood.  To these they set fire and withdrew to a
distance, keeping up a constant shower of missiles to
prevent the Moors from sallying forth to extinguish
the flames.  The stanchions were rapidly consumed,
and when they gave way the tower fell to the
ground.  Some of the Moors were crushed among the
ruins; others were flung to a distance and dashed
among the rocks; those who survived were instantly
put to the sword.
</p>

<p>
The fleet of the emir arrived at Ceuta about the
hour of vespers.  He landed, but found the gates
closed against him.  The countess herself spoke to
him from a tower, and set him at defiance.  The
emir immediately laid siege to the city.  He
consulted the astrologer Yuza, who told him that for
seven days his star would have the ascendant over
that of the youth Alarbot, but after that time the
youth would be safe from his power, and would
effect his ruin.
</p>

<p>
Alahor immediately ordered the city to be assailed
on every side, and at length carried it by storm.
The countess took refuge with her forces in the
citadel, and made desperate defence; but the walls
were sapped and mined, and she saw that all resistance
would soon be unavailing.  Her only thoughts
now were to conceal her child.  "Surely," said she,
"they will not think of seeking him among the
dead."  She led him therefore into the dark and
dismal chapel.  "Thou art not afraid to be alone
in this darkness, my child?" said she.
</p>

<p>
"No, mother," replied the boy; "darkness gives
silence and sleep."  She conducted him to the tomb
of Florinda.  "Fearest thou the dead, my child?"  "No
mother; the dead can do no harm, and what
should I fear from my sister?"
</p>

<p>
The countess opened the sepulchre.  "Listen,
my son," said she.  "There are fierce and cruel
people who have come hither to murder thee.  Stay
here in company with thy sister, and be quiet as
thou dost value thy life!"  The boy, who was of a
courageous nature, did as he was bidden, and remained
there all that day, and all the night, and the
next day until the third hour.
</p>

<p>
In the meantime the walls of the citadel were
sapped, the troops of the emir poured in at the
breach, and a great part of the garrison was put to
the sword.  The countess was taken prisoner and
brought before the emir.  She appeared in his
presence with a haughty demeanour, as if she had
been a queen receiving homage; but when he
demanded her son, she faltered and turned pale, and
replied, "My son is with the dead."
</p>

<p>
"Countess," said the emir, "I am not to be
deceived; tell me where you have concealed
the boy, or tortures shall wring from you the
secret."
</p>

<p>
"Emir," replied the countess, "may the greatest
torments be my portion, both here and hereafter, if
what I speak be not the truth.  My darling child
lies buried with the dead."
</p>

<p>
The emir was confounded by the solemnity of her
words; but the withered astrologer Yuza, who stood
by his side regarding the countess from beneath his
bushed eyebrows, perceived trouble in her countenance
and equivocation in her words.  "Leave this
matter to me," whispered he to Alahor; "I will
produce the child."
</p>

<p>
He ordered strict search to be made by the soldiery
and he obliged the countess to be always present.
When they came to the chapel, her cheek turned
pale and her lip quivered.  "This," said the subtile
astrologer, "is the place of concealment!"
</p>

<p>
The search throughout the chapel, however, was
equally vain, and the soldiers were about to depart
when Yuza remarked a slight gleam of joy in the
eye of the countess.  "We are leaving our prey
behind," thought he; "the countess is exulting."
</p>

<p>
He now called to mind the words of her asseveration,
that her child was with the dead.  Turning
suddenly to the soldiers he ordered them to search
the sepulchres.  "If you find him not," said he,
"drag forth the bones of that wanton Cava, that
they may be burnt, and the ashes scattered to the
winds."
</p>

<p>
The soldiers searched among the tombs and
found that of Florinda partly open.  Within lay
the boy in the sound sleep of childhood, and one of
the soldiers took him gently in his arms to bear him
to the emir.
</p>

<p>
When the countess beheld that her child was
discovered, she rushed into the presence of Alahor,
and, forgetting all her pride, threw herself upon her
knees before him.
</p>

<p>
"Mercy! mercy!" cried she in piercing accents,
"mercy on my son&mdash;my only child!  O Emir! listen
to a mother's prayer and my lips shall kiss thy
feet.  As thou art merciful to him so may the most
high God have mercy upon thee, and heap blessings
on thy head."
</p>

<p>
"Bear that frantic woman hence," said the emir,
"but guard her well."
</p>

<p>
The countess was dragged away by the soldiery,
without regard to her struggles and her cries, and
confined in a dungeon of the citadel.
</p>

<p>
The child was now brought to the emir.  He had
been awakened by the tumult, but gazed fearlessly
on the stern countenances of the soldiers.  Had the
heart of the emir been capable of pity, it would have
been touched by the tender youth and innocent
beauty of the child; but his heart was as the
nether millstone, and he was bent upon the
destruction of the whole family of Julian.  Calling
to him the astrologer, he gave the child into his
charge with a secret command.  The withered son
of the desert took the boy by the hand and led
him up the winding staircase of a tower.  When
they reached the summit, Yuza placed him on the
battlements.
</p>

<p>
"Cling not to me, my child," said he; "there is no
danger."  "Father, I fear not," said the undaunted
boy; "yet it is a wondrous height!"
</p>

<p>
The child looked around with delighted eyes.
The breeze blew his curling locks from about his
face, and his cheek glowed at the boundless prospect;
for the tower was reared upon that lofty promontory
on which Hercules founded one of his pillars.  The
surges of the sea were heard far below, beating
upon the rocks, the sea-gull screamed and wheeled
about the foundations of the tower, and the sails of
lofty caraccas were as mere specks on the bosom of
the deep.
</p>

<p>
"Dost thou know yonder land beyond the blue
water?" said Yuza.
</p>

<p>
"It is Spain," replied the boy; "it is the land of
my father and my mother."
</p>

<p>
"Then stretch forth thy hands and bless it, my
child," said the astrologer.
</p>

<p>
The boy let go his hold of the wall; and, as he
stretched forth his hands, the aged son of Ishmael,
exerting all the strength of his withered limbs,
suddenly pushed him over the battlements.  He
fell headlong from the top of that tall tower, and
not a bone in his tender frame but was crushed
upon the rocks beneath.
</p>

<p>
Alahor came to the foot of the winding stairs.
</p>

<p>
"Is the boy safe?" cried he.
</p>

<p>
"He is safe," replied Yuza; "come and behold
the truth with thine own eyes."
</p>

<p>
The emir ascended the tower and looked over the
battlements, and beheld the body of the child, a
shapeless mass on the rocks far below, and the
seagulls hovering about it; and he gave orders that it
should be thrown into the sea, which was done.
</p>

<p>
On the following morning the countess was led
forth from her dungeon into the public square.
She knew of the death of her child, and that her own
death was at hand, but she neither wept nor
supplicated.  Her hair was dishevelled, her eyes were
haggard with watching, and her cheek was as the
monumental stone; but there were the remains of
commanding beauty in her countenance, and the
majesty of her presence awed even the rabble into
respect.
</p>

<p>
A multitude of Christian prisoners were then
brought forth, and Alahor cried out: "Behold the
wife of Count Julian! behold one of that traitorous
family which has brought ruin upon yourselves and
upon your country!"  And he ordered that they
should stone her to death.  But the Christians
drew back with horror from the deed, and said,
"In the hand of God is vengeance; let not her blood
be upon our heads."  Upon this the emir swore with
horrid imprecations that whoever of the captives
refused should himself be stoned to death.  So
the cruel order was executed, and the Countess
Frandina perished by the hands of her countrymen.
Having thus accomplished his barbarous errand,
the emir embarked for Spain, and ordered the citadel
of Ceuta to be set on fire, and crossed the straits at
night by the light of its towering flames.
</p>

<p>
The death of Count Julian, which took place not
long after, closed the tragic story of his family.  How
he died remains involved in doubt.  Some assert
that the cruel Alahor pursued him to his retreat
among the mountains, and, having taken him
prisoner, beheaded him; others that the Moors
confined him in a dungeon, and put an end to his life
with lingering torments; while others affirm that
the tower of the castle of Marcuello, near Huesca, in
Aragon, in which he took refuge, fell on him and
crushed him to pieces.  All agree that his latter end
was miserable in the extreme and his death violent.
The curse of Heaven, which had thus pursued him
to the grave, was extended to the very place which
had given him shelter; for we are told that the castle
is no longer inhabited on account of the strange and
horrible noises that are heard in it; and that visions
of armed men are seen above it in the air; which are
supposed to be the troubled spirits of the apostate
Christians who favoured the cause of the traitor.
</p>

<p>
In after-times a stone sepulchre was shown, outside
of the chapel of the castle, as the tomb of Count
Julian; but the traveller and the pilgrim avoided it,
or bestowed upon it a malediction; and the name of
Julian has remained a by-word and a scorn in the
land for the warning of all generations.  Such ever
be the lot of him who betrays his country.

A GOBOTO NIGHT
</h3>

<p class="t3">
JACK LONDON
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="t3">
I
</p>

<p>
At Goboto the traders come off their schooners
and the planters drift in from far, wild coasts,
and one and all they assume shoes, white
duck trousers, and various other appearances of
civilisation.  At Goboto mail is received, bills are
paid, and newspapers, rarely more than five weeks
old, are accessible; for the little island, belted with
its coral reefs, affords safe anchorage, is the steamer
port of call, and serves as the distributing point for
the whole wide-scattered group.
</p>

<p>
Life at Goboto is heated, unhealthy, and lurid,
and for its size it asserts the distinction of more cases
of acute alcoholism than any other spot in the world.
Guvutu, over in the Solomons, claims that it drinks
between drinks.  Goboto does not deny this.  It
merely states, in passing, that in the Goboton
chronology no such interval of time is known.  It also
points out its import statistics, which show a far
larger per capita consumption of spirituous liquors.
Guvutu explains this on the basis that Goboto does
a larger business and has more visitors.  Goboto
retorts that its resident population is smaller and
that its visitors are thirstier.  And the discussion
goes on interminably, principally because of the fact
that the disputants do not live long enough to settle
it.
</p>

<p>
Goboto is not large.  The island is only a quarter
of a mile in diameter, and on it are situated an
admiralty coal-shed (where a few tons of coal have
lain untouched for twenty years), the barracks for a
handful of black labourers, a big store and
warehouse with sheet-iron roofs, and a bungalow
inhabited by the manager and his two clerks.  They
are the white population.  An average of one man
out of the three is always to be found down with
fever.  The job at Goboto is a hard one.  It is the
policy of the company to treat its patrons well, as
invading companies have found out, and it is the task
of the manager and clerks to do the treating.
Throughout the year traders and recruiters arrive
from far, dry cruises, and planters from equally
distant and dry shores, bringing with them magnificent
thirsts.  Goboto is the Mecca of sprees, and
when they have spreed they go back to their
schooners and plantations to recuperate.
</p>

<p>
Some of the less hardy require as much as six
months between visits.  But for the manager and
his assistants there are no such intervals.  They are
on the spot, and week by week, blown in by monsoon
or southeast trade, the schooners come to anchor,
cargoed with copra, ivory nuts, pearl-shell, hawksbill
turtle, and thirst.
</p>

<p>
It is a very hard job at Goboto.  That is why the
pay is twice that on other stations, and that is why
the company selects only courageous and intrepid
men for this particular station.  They last no more
than a year or so, when the wreckage of them is
shipped back to Australia, or the remains of them
are buried in the sand across on the windward side
of the islet.  Johnny Bassett, almost the legendary
hero of Goboto, broke all records.  He was a
remittance man with a remarkable constitution, and he
lasted seven years.  His dying request was duly
observed by his clerks, who pickled him in a cask of
trade-rum (paid for out of their own salaries) and
shipped him back to his people in England.
</p>

<p>
Nevertheless, at Goboto, they tried to be
gentlemen.  For that matter, though something was
wrong with them, they were gentlemen, and had
been gentlemen.  That was why the great unwritten
rule of Goboto was that visitors should put on
pants and shoes.  Breech-clouts, lava-lavas, and
bare legs were not tolerated.  When Captain Jensen,
the wildest of the Blackbirders though descended
from old New York Knickerbocker stock, surged
in, clad in loin-cloth, undershirt, two belted
revolvers and a sheath-knife, he was stopped at the beach.
This was in the days of Johnny Bassett, ever a
stickler in matters of etiquette.  Captain Jensen
stood up in the sternsheets of his whaleboat and
denied the existence of pants on his schooner.  Also,
he affirmed his intention of coming ashore.  They
of Goboto nursed him back to health from a bullet-hole
through his shoulder, and in addition handsomely
begged his pardon, for no pants had they
found on his schooner.  And finally, on the first day
he sat up, Johnny Bassett kindly but firmly assisted
his guest into a pair of pants of his own.  This
was the great precedent.  In all the succeeding years
it had never been violated.  White men and pants
were undivorceable.  Only niggers ran naked.  Pants
constituted caste.
</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<p class="t3">
II
</p>

<p>
On this night things were, with one exception, in
nowise different from any other night.  Seven of
them, with glimmering eyes and steady legs, had
capped a day of Scotch with swivel-sticked cocktails
and sat down to dinner.  Jacketed, trousered, and
shod, they were: Jerry McMurtrey, the manager;
Eddy Little and Jack Andrews, clerks; Captain
Stapler, of the recruiting ketch <i>Merry</i>; Darby
Shryleton, planter from Tito-Ito; Peter Gee, a half-caste
Chinese pearl-buyer who ranged from Ceylon to the
Paumotus, and Alfred Deacon, a visitor who had
stopped off from the last steamer.  At first wine was
served by the black servants to those that drank it,
though all quickly shifted back to Scotch and soda,
pickling their food as they ate it, ere it went into
their calcined, pickled stomachs.
</p>

<p>
Over their coffee, they heard the rumble of an
anchor-chain through a hawse-pipe, tokening the
arrival of a vessel.
</p>

<p>
"It's David Grief," Peter Gee remarked.
</p>

<p>
"How do you know?" Deacon demanded truculently,
and then went on to deny the half-caste's
knowledge.  "You chaps put on a lot of side over a
new chum.  I've done some sailing myself, and this
naming a craft when its sail is only a blur, or
naming a man by the sound of his anchor&mdash;it's&mdash;it's
unadulterated poppycock."
</p>

<p>
Peter Gee was engaged in lighting a cigarette,
and did not answer.
</p>

<p>
"Some of the niggers do amazing things that
way," McMurtrey interposed tactfully.
</p>

<p>
As with the others, this conduct of their visitor
jarred on the manager.  From the moment of Peter
Gee's arrival that afternoon Deacon had manifested
a tendency to pick on him.  He had disputed his
statements and been generally rude.
</p>

<p>
"Maybe it's because Peter's got Chink blood in
him," had been Andrews' hypothesis.  "Deacon's
Australian, you know, and they're daffy down there
on colour."
</p>

<p>
"I fancy that's it," McMurtrey had agreed.  "But
we can't permit any bullying, especially of a man
like Peter Gee, who's whiter than most white men."
</p>

<p>
In this the manager had been in nowise wrong.
Peter Gee was that rare creature, a good as well as
clever Eurasian.  In fact, it was the stolid integrity
of the Chinese blood that toned the recklessness
and licentiousness of the English blood which had
run in his father's veins.  Also, he was better
educated than any man there, spoke better English as
well as several other tongues, and knew and lived
more of their own ideals of gentlemanness than they
did themselves.  And, finally, he was a gentle soul.
Violence he deprecated, though he had killed men in
his time.  Turbulence he abhorred.  He always
avoided it as he would the plague.
</p>

<p>
Captain Stapler stepped in to help McMurtrey:
</p>

<p>
"I remember, when I changed schooners and
came into Altman, the niggers knew right off the
bat it was me.  I wasn't expected, either, much less
to be in another craft.  They told the trader it was
me.  He used the glasses, and wouldn't believe
them.  But they did know.  Told me afterward
they could see it sticking out all over the schooner
that I was running her."
</p>

<p>
Deacon ignored him, and returned to the attack
on the pearl-buyer.
</p>

<p>
"How do you know from the sound of the anchor
that it was this whatever-you-called-him man?" he
challenged.
</p>

<p>
"There are so many things that go to make up
such a judgment," Peter Gee answered.  "It's very
hard to explain.  It would require almost a text
book."
</p>

<p>
"I thought so," Deacon sneered.  "Explanation
that doesn't explain is easy."
</p>

<p>
"Who's for bridge?" Eddy Little, the second
clerk, interrupted, looking up expectantly and
starting to shuffle.  "You'll play, won't you, Peter?"
</p>

<p>
"If he does, he's a bluffer," Deacon cut back.
"I'm getting tired of all this poppycock.  Mr. Gee,
you will favour me and put yourself in a better light
if you tell how you know who that man was that
just dropped anchor.  After that I'll play you
piquet."
</p>

<p>
"I'd prefer bridge," Peter answered.  "As for the
other thing, it's something like this: By the sound
it was a small craft&mdash;no square-rigger.  No whistle,
no siren, was blown&mdash;again a small craft.  It anchored
close in&mdash;still again a small craft, for
steamers and big ships must drop hook outside the
middle shoal.  Now the entrance is tortuous.  There is
no recruiting nor trading captain in the group who
dares to run the passage after dark.  Certainly no
stranger would.  There were two exceptions.  The
first was Margonville.  But he was executed by the
High Court at Fiji.  Remains the other exception,
David Grief.  Night or day, in any weather, he runs
the passage.  This is well known to all.  A possible
factor, in case Grief were somewhere else, would be
some young dare-devil of a skipper.  In this
connection, in the first place, I don't know of any, nor
does anybody else.  In the second place, David
Grief is in these waters, cruising on the <i>Gunga</i>,
which is shortly scheduled to leave here for
Karo-Karo.  I spoke to Grief, on the <i>Gunga</i>, in Sandfly
Passage, day before yesterday.  He was putting a
trader ashore on a new station.  He said he was
going to call in at Babo, and then come on to
Goboto.  He has had ample time to get here.  I have
heard an anchor drop.  Who else than David Grief
can it be?  Captain Donovan is skipper of the
<i>Gunga</i>, and him I know too well to believe that he'd run
in to Goboto after dark unless his owner were in
charge.  In a few minutes David Grief will enter
through that door and say, 'In Guvutu they merely
drink between drinks.'  I'll wager fifty pounds he's
the man that enters and that his words will be, 'In
Guvutu they merely drink between drinks.'"
</p>

<p>
Deacon was for the moment crushed.  The sullen
blood rose darkly in his face.
</p>

<p>
"Well, he's answered you," McMurtrey laughed
genially.  "And I'll back his bet myself for a couple
of sovereigns."
</p>

<p>
"Bridge!  Who's going to take a hand?" Eddy
Little cried impatiently.  "Come on, Peter!"
</p>

<p>
"The rest of you play," Deacon said.  "He and
I are going to play piquet."
</p>

<p>
"I'd prefer bridge," Peter Gee said mildly.
</p>

<p>
"Don't you play piquet?"
</p>

<p>
The pearl-buyer nodded.
</p>

<p>
"Then come on.  Maybe I can show I know
more about that than I do about anchors."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, I say&mdash;&mdash;" McMurtrey began.
</p>

<p>
"You can play bridge," Deacon shut him off.
"We prefer piquet."
</p>

<p>
Reluctantly, Peter Gee was bullied into a game
that he knew would be unhappy.
</p>

<p>
"Only a rubber," he said, as he cut for deal.
</p>

<p>
"For how much?" Deacon asked.
</p>

<p>
Peter Gee shrugged his shoulders.  "As you please."
</p>

<p>
"Hundred up&mdash;five pounds a game?"
</p>

<p>
Peter Gee agreed.
</p>

<p>
"With the lurch double, of course, ten pounds?"
</p>

<p>
"All right," said Peter Gee.
</p>

<p>
At another table four of the others sat in at
bridge.  Captain Stapler, who was no card-player,
looked on and replenished the long glasses of Scotch
that stood at each man's right hand.  McMurtrey,
with poorly concealed apprehension, followed as well
as he could what went on at the piquet table.  His
fellow Englishmen as well were shocked by the
behaviour of the Australian, and all were troubled by
fear of some untoward act on his part.  That he
was working up his animosity against the half-caste,
and that the explosion might come any time,
was apparent to all.
</p>

<p>
"I hope Peter loses," McMurtrey said in an undertone.
</p>

<p>
"Not if he has any luck," Andrews answered.
"He's a wizard at piquet.  I know by experience."
</p>

<p>
That Peter Gee was lucky was patent from the
continual badgering of Deacon, who filled his glass
frequently.  He had lost the first game, and, from
his remarks, was losing the second, when the door
opened and David Grief entered.
</p>

<p>
"In Guvutu they merely drink between drinks,"
he remarked casually to the assembled company,
ere he gripped the manager's hand.  "Hello, Mac!
Say, my skipper's down in the whaleboat.  He's got
a silk shirt, a tie, and tennis shoes, all complete, but
he wants you to send a pair of pants down.  Mine
are too small, but yours will fit him.  Hello, Eddy!
How's that <i>ngari-ngari</i>?  You up, Jock?  The
miracle has happened.  No one down with fever, and
no one remarkably drunk."  He sighed, "I suppose
the night is young yet.  Hello, Peter!  Did you
catch that big squall an hour after you left us?  We
had to let go the second anchor."
</p>

<p>
While he was being introduced to Deacon,
McMurtrey dispatched a house-boy with the pants,
and when Captain Donovan came in it was as a
white man should&mdash;at least in Goboto.
</p>

<p>
Deacon lost the second game, and an outburst
heralded the fact.  Peter Gee devoted himself to
lighting a cigarette and keeping quiet.
</p>

<p>
"What!&mdash;are you quitting because you're
ahead?" Deacon demanded.
</p>

<p>
Grief raised his eyebrows questioningly to
McMurtrey, who frowned back his own disgust.
</p>

<p>
"It's the rubber," Peter Gee answered.
</p>

<p>
"It takes three games to make a rubber.  It's my
deal.  Come on!"
</p>

<p>
Peter Gee acquiesced, and the third game was on.
</p>

<p>
"Young whelp&mdash;he needs a lacing," McMurtrey
muttered to Grief.  "Come on, let us quit, you
chaps.  I want to keep an eye on him.  If he goes
too far I'll throw him out on the beach, company
instructions or no."
</p>

<p>
"Who is he?" Grief queried.
</p>

<p>
"A left-over from last steamer.  Company's orders
to treat him nice.  He's looking to invest in a
plantation.  Has a ten-thousand-pound letter of
credit with the company.  He's got 'all-white
Australia' on the brain.  Thinks because his skin is
white and because his father was once Attorney-General
of the Commonwealth that he can be a
cur.  That's why he's picking on Peter, and you
know Peter's the last man in the world to make
trouble or incur trouble.  Damn the company.  I
didn't engage to wet-nurse its infants with bank
accounts.  Come on, fill your glass, Grief.  The man's
a blighter, a blithering blighter."
</p>

<p>
"Maybe he's only young," Grief suggested.
</p>

<p>
"He can't contain his drink&mdash;that's clear."  The
manager glared his disgust and wrath.  "If he raises
a hand to Peter, so help me, I'll give him a licking
myself, the little overgrown cad!"
</p>

<p>
The pearl-buyer pulled the pegs out of the
cribbage board on which he was scoring and sat back.
He had won the third game.  He glanced across to
Eddy Little, saying:
</p>

<p>
"I'm ready for the bridge, now."
</p>

<p>
"I wouldn't be a quitter," Deacon snarled.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, really, I'm tired of the game," Peter Gee
assured him with his habitual quietness.
</p>

<p>
"Come on and be game," Deacon bullied.  "One
more.  You can't take my money that way.  I'm
out fifteen pounds.  Double or quits."
</p>

<p>
McMurtrey was about to interpose, but Grief
restrained him with his eyes.
</p>

<p>
"If it positively is the last, all right," said Peter
Gee, gathering up the cards.  "It's my deal, I believe.
As I understand it, this final is for fifteen
pounds.  Either you owe me thirty or we quit
even?"
</p>

<p>
"That's it, chappie.  Either we break even or I
pay you thirty."
</p>

<p>
"Getting blooded, eh?" Grief remarked, drawing
up a chair.
</p>

<p>
The other men stood or sat around the table, and
Deacon played again in bad luck.  That he was a
good player was clear.  The cards were merely
running against him.  That he could not take his ill
luck with equanimity was equally clear.  He was
guilty of sharp, ugly curses, and he snapped and
growled at the imperturbable half-caste.  In the
end Peter Gee counted out, while Deacon had not
even made his fifty points.  He glowered
speechlessly at his opponent.
</p>

<p>
"Looks like a lurch," said Grief.
</p>

<p>
"Which is double," said Peter Gee.
</p>

<p>
"There's no need your telling me," Deacon
snarled.  "I've studied arithmetic.  I owe you
forty-five pounds.  There, take it!"
</p>

<p>
The way in which he flung the nine five-pound
notes on the table was an insult in itself.  Peter Gee
was even quieter, and flew no signals of resentment.
</p>

<p>
"You've got fool's luck, but you can't play cards,
I can tell you that much," Deacon went on.  "I
could teach you cards."
</p>

<p>
The half-caste smiled and nodded acquiescence as
he folded up the money.
</p>

<p>
"There's a little game called casino&mdash;I wonder if
you ever heard of it?&mdash;a child's game."
</p>

<p>
"I've seen it played," the half-caste murmured
gently.
</p>

<p>
"What's that?" snapped Deacon.  "Maybe you
think you can play it?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, no, not for a moment.  I'm afraid I haven't
head enough for it."
</p>

<p>
"It's a bully game, casino," Grief broke in
pleasantly.  "I like it very much."
</p>

<p>
Deacon ignored him.
</p>

<p>
"I'll play you ten quid a game&mdash;thirty-one points
out," was the challenge to Peter Gee.  "And I'll
show you how little you know about cards.  Come
on!  Where's a full deck?"
</p>

<p>
"No, thanks," the half-caste answered.  "They
are waiting for me in order to make up a bridge
set."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, come on," Eddy Little begged eagerly.
"Come on, Peter, let's get started."
</p>

<p>
"Afraid of a little game like casino," Deacon girded.
"Maybe the stakes are too high.  I'll play you
for pennies&mdash;or farthings, if you say so."
</p>

<p>
The man's conduct was a hurt and an affront
to all of them.  McMurtrey could stand it no
longer.
</p>

<p>
"Now hold on, Deacon.  He says he doesn't want
to play.  Let him alone."
</p>

<p>
Deacon turned raging upon his host; but before
he could blurt out his abuse, Grief had stepped into
the breach.
</p>

<p>
"I'd like to play casino with you," he said.
</p>

<p>
"What do you know about it?"
</p>

<p>
"Not much, but I'm willing to learn."
</p>

<p>
"Well, I'm not teaching for pennies to-night."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, that's all right," Grief answered.  "I'll play
for almost any sum&mdash;within reason, of course."
</p>

<p>
Deacon proceeded to dispose of this intruder with
one stroke.
</p>

<p>
"I'll play you a hundred pounds a game, if that
will do you any good."
</p>

<p>
Grief beamed his delight.  "That will be all right,
very right.  Let us begin.  Do you count sweeps?"
</p>

<p>
Deacon was taken aback.  He had not expected a
Goboton trader to be anything but crushed by such
a proposition.
</p>

<p>
"Do you count sweeps?" Grief repeated.
</p>

<p>
Andrews had brought him a new deck, and he was
throwing out the joker.
</p>

<p>
"Certainly not," Deacon answered.  "That's a
sissy game."
</p>

<p>
"I'm glad," Grief coincided.  "I don't like sissy
games either."
</p>

<p>
"You don't, eh?  Well, then, I'll tell you what
we'll do.  We'll play for five hundred pounds a
game."
</p>

<p>
Again Deacon was taken aback.
</p>

<p>
"I'm agreeable," Grief said, beginning to shuffle.
"Cards and spades go out first, of course, and then
big and little casino, and the aces in the bridge order
of value.  Is that right?"
</p>

<p>
"You're a lot of jokers down here," Deacon
laughed, but his laughter was strained.  "How do
I know you've got the money?"
</p>

<p>
"By the same token I know you've got it.  Mac,
how's my credit with the company?"
</p>

<p>
"For all you want," the manager answered.
</p>

<p>
"You personally guarantee that?" Deacon demanded.
</p>

<p>
"I certainly do," McMurtrey said.  "Depend
upon it, the company will honour his paper up and
pass your letter of credit."
</p>

<p>
"Low deals," Grief said, placing the deck before
Deacon on the table.
</p>

<p>
The latter hesitated in the midst of the cut and
looked around with querulous misgiving at the faces
of the others.  The clerks and captains nodded.
</p>

<p>
"You're all strangers to me," Deacon complained.
"How am I to know?  Money on paper isn't always
the real thing."
</p>

<p>
Then it was that Peter Gee, drawing a wallet
from his pocket and borrowing a fountain pen from
McMurtrey, went into action.
</p>

<p>
"I haven't gone to buying yet," the half-caste
explained, "so the account is intact.  I'll just indorse
it over to you, Grief.  It's for fifteen thousand.
There, look at it."
</p>

<p>
Deacon intercepted the letter of credit as it was
being passed across the table.  He read it slowly,
then glanced up at McMurtrey.
</p>

<p>
"Is that right?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes.  It's just the same as your own, and just
as good.  The company's paper is always good."
</p>

<p>
Deacon cut the cards, won the deal, and gave
them a thorough shuffle.  But his luck was still
against him, and he lost the game.
</p>

<p>
"Another game," he said.  "We didn't say how
many, and you can't quit with me a loser.  I want
action."
</p>

<p>
Grief shuffled and passed the cards for the cut.
</p>

<p>
"Let's play for a thousand," Deacon said, when
he had lost the second game.  And when the thousand
had gone the way of the two five hundred bets
he proposed to play for two thousand.
</p>

<p>
"That's progression," McMurtrey warned, and
was rewarded by a glare from Deacon.  But the
manager was insistent.  "You don't have to play
progression, Grief, unless you're foolish."
</p>

<p>
"Who's playing this game?" Deacon flamed at
his host; and then, to Grief: "I've lost two
thousand to you.  Will you play for two thousand?"
</p>

<p>
Grief nodded, the fourth game began, and Deacon
won.  The manifest unfairness of such betting
was known to all of them.  Though he had lost
three games out of four, Deacon had lost no money.
By the child's device of doubling his wager with
each loss, he was bound, with the first game he
won, no matter how long delayed, to be even again.
</p>

<p>
He now evinced an unspoken desire to stop, but
Grief passed the deck to be cut.
</p>

<p>
"What?" Deacon cried.  "You want more?"
</p>

<p>
"Haven't got anything yet," Grief murmured
whimsically, as he began the deal.  "For the usual
five hundred, I suppose?"
</p>

<p>
The shame of what he had done must have tingled
in Deacon, for he answered, "No, we'll play
for a thousand.  And say!  Thirty-one points is too
long.  Why not twenty-one points out&mdash;if it isn't
too rapid for you?"
</p>

<p>
"That will make it a nice, quick little game,"
Grief agreed.
</p>

<p>
The former method of play was repeated.  Deacon
lost two games, doubled the stake, and was
again even.  But Grief was patient, though the
thing occurred several times in the next hour's play.
Then happened what he was waiting for&mdash;a lengthening
in the series of losing games for Deacon.  The
latter doubled to four thousand and lost, doubled
to eight thousand and lost, and then proposed to
double to sixteen thousand.
</p>

<p>
Grief shook his head.  "You can't do that, you
know.  You're only ten thousand credit with the
company."
</p>

<p>
"You mean you won't give me action?" Deacon
asked hoarsely.  "You mean that with eight
thousand of my money you're going to quit?"
</p>

<p>
Grief smiled and shook his head.
</p>

<p>
"It's robbery, plain robbery," Deacon went on.
"You take my money and won't give me action."
</p>

<p>
"No, you're wrong.  I'm perfectly willing to give
you what action you've got coming to you.  You've
got two thousand pounds of action yet."
</p>

<p>
"Well, we'll play it," Deacon took him up.  "You
cut."
</p>

<p>
The game was played in silence, save for irritable
remarks and curses from Deacon.  Silently the
onlookers filled and sipped their long Scotch glasses.
Grief took no notice of his opponent's outbursts, but
concentrated on the game.  He was really playing
cards, and there were fifty-two in the deck to be kept
track of, and of which he did keep track.  Two thirds
of the way through the last deal he threw down his
hand.
</p>

<p>
"Cards put me out," he said.  "I have twenty-seven."
</p>

<p>
"If you've made a mistake," Deacon threatened,
his face white and drawn.
</p>

<p>
"Then I shall have lost.  Count them."
</p>

<p>
Grief passed over his stack of takings, and Deacon,
with trembling fingers, verified the count.  He half
shoved his chair back from the table and emptied his
glass.  He looked about him at unsympathetic faces.
</p>

<p>
"I fancy I'll be catching the next steamer for
Sydney," he said, and for the first time his speech
was quiet and without bluster.
</p>

<p>
As Grief told them afterward: "Had he whined or
raised a roar I wouldn't have given him that last
chance.  As it was, he took his medicine like a man,
and I had to do it."
</p>

<p>
Deacon glanced at his watch, simulated a weary
yawn, and started to rise.
</p>

<p>
"Wait," Grief said.  "Do you want further
action?"
</p>

<p>
The other sank down in his chair, strove to speak,
but could not, licked his dry lips, and nodded his
head.
</p>

<p>
"Captain Donovan here sails at daylight in the
<i>Gunga</i> for Karo-Karo," Grief began with seeming
irrelevance.  "Karo-Karo is a ring of sand in the sea,
with a few thousand cocoanut trees.  Pandanus
grows there, but they can't grow sweet potatoes nor
taro.  There are about eight hundred natives, a
king and two prime ministers, and the last three
named are the only ones who wear any clothes.  It's
a sort of God-forsaken little hole, and once a year I
send a schooner up from Goboto.  The drinking
water is brackish, but old Tom Butler has survived
on it for a dozen years.  He's the only white man
there, and he has a boat's crew of five Santa Cruz
boys who would run away or kill him if they could.
That is why they were sent there.  They can't run
away.  He is always supplied with the hard cases
from the plantations.  There are no missionaries.  Two
native Samoan teachers were clubbed to death on
the beach when they landed several years ago.
</p>

<p>
"Naturally, you are wondering what it is all
about.  But have patience.  As I have said, Captain
Donovan sails on the annual trip to Karo-Karo at
daylight to-morrow.  Tom Butler is old, and getting
quite helpless.  I've tried to retire him to Australia,
but he says he wants to remain and die on Karo-Karo,
and he will in the next year or so.  He's a
queer old codger.  Now the time is due for me to
send some white man up to take the work off his
hands.  I wonder how you'd like the job.  You'd
have to stay two years.
</p>

<p>
"Hold on!  I've not finished.  You've talked
frequently of action this evening.  There's no action
in betting away what you've never sweated for.
The money you've lost to me was left you by your
father or some other relative who did the sweating.
But two years of work as trader on Karo-Karo would
mean something.  I'll bet the ten thousand I've won
from you against two years of your time.  If you
win, the money's yours.  If you lose, you take the
job at Karo-Karo and sail at daylight.  Now that's
what might be called real action.  Will you play?"
</p>

<p>
Deacon could not speak.  His throat lumped and
he nodded his head as he reached for the cards.
</p>

<p>
"One thing more," Grief said.  "I can do even
better.  If you lose, two years of your time are
mine&mdash;naturally without wages.  Nevertheless, I'll pay
you wages.  If your work is satisfactory, if you
observe all instructions and rules, I'll pay you five
thousand pounds a year for two years.  The money
will be deposited with the company, to be paid to
you, with interest, when the time expires.  Is that
all right?"
</p>

<p>
"Too much so," Deacon stammered.  "You
are unfair to yourself.  A trader only gets ten or
fifteen pounds a month."
</p>

<p>
"Put it down to action, then," Grief said, with an
air of dismissal.  "And before we begin, I'll jot down
several of the rules.  These you will repeat aloud
every morning during the two years&mdash;if you lose.
They are for the good of your soul.  When you have
repeated them aloud seven hundred and thirty
Karo-Karo mornings I am confident they will be in
your memory to stay.  Lend me your pen, Mac.
Now, let's see&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
He wrote steadily and rapidly for some minutes,
then proceeded to read the matter aloud:
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
"<i>I must always remember that one man is as good as another,
save and except when he thinks he is better.</i>
</p>

<p>
"<i>No matter how drunk I am I must not fail to be a gentleman.
A gentleman is a man who is gentle.  Note: It would be better
not to get drunk.</i>
</p>

<p>
"<i>When I play a man's game with men, I must play like a man.</i>
</p>

<p>
"<i>A good curse, rightly used and rarely, is an efficient thing.
Too many curses spoil the cursing.  Note: A curse cannot
change a card sequence nor cause the wind to blow.</i>
</p>

<p>
"<i>There is no license for a man to be less than a man.  Ten
thousand pounds cannot purchase such a license.</i>"
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
At the beginning of the reading Deacon's face had
gone white with anger.  Then had arisen, from neck
to forehead, a slow and terrible flush that deepened
to the end of the reading.
</p>

<p>
"There, that will be all," Grief said, as he folded
the paper and tossed it to the centre of the table.
"Are you still ready to play the game?"
</p>

<p>
"I deserve it," Deacon muttered brokenly.  "I've
been an ass.  Mr. Gee, before I know whether I win
or lose, I want to apologise.  Maybe it was the
whiskey, I don't know, but I'm an ass, a cad, a
bounder&mdash;everything that's rotten."
</p>

<p>
He held out his hand, and the half-caste took it
beamingly.
</p>

<p>
"I say, Grief," he blurted out, "the boy's all right.
Call the whole thing off, and let's forget it in a final
nightcap."
</p>

<p>
Grief showed signs of debating, but Deacon cried:
</p>

<p>
"No; I won't permit it.  I'm not a quitter.  If it's
Karo-Karo, it's Karo-Karo.  There's nothing more
to it."
</p>

<p>
"Right," said Grief, as he began the shuffle.  "If
he's the right stuff to go to Karo-Karo, Karo-Karo
won't do him any harm."
</p>

<p>
The game was close and hard.  Three times they
divided the deck between them and "cards" was
not scored.  At the beginning of the fifth and last
deal, Deacon needed three points to go out and
Grief needed four.  "Cards" alone would put
Deacon out, and he played for "cards."  He no
longer muttered or cursed, and played his best game
of the evening.  Incidentally he gathered in the two
black aces and the ace of hearts.
</p>

<p>
"I suppose you can name the four cards I hold,"
he challenged, as the last of the deal was exhausted
and he picked up his hand.
</p>

<p>
Grief nodded.
</p>

<p>
"Then name them."
</p>

<p>
"The knave of spades, the deuce of spades, the
tray of hearts, and the ace of diamonds," Grief
answered.
</p>

<p>
Those behind Deacon and looking at his hand
made no sign.  Yet the naming had been correct.
</p>

<p>
"I fancy you play casino better than I," Deacon
acknowledged.  "I can name only three of yours,
a knave, an ace, and big casino."
</p>

<p>
"Wrong.  There aren't five aces in the deck.
You've taken in three and you hold the fourth in
your hand now."
</p>

<p>
"By Jove, you're right," Deacon admitted.  "I
did scoop in three.  Anyway, I'll make 'cards' on
you.  That's all I need."
</p>

<p>
"I'll let you save little casino&mdash;"  Grief paused to
calculate.  "Yes, and the ace as well, and still I'll
make 'cards' and go out with big casino.  Play."
</p>

<p>
"No 'cards,' and I win!" Deacon exulted as the
last of the hand was played.  "I go out on little
casino and the four aces.  'Big casino' and 'spades'
only bring you to twenty."
</p>

<p>
Grief shook his head.  "Some mistake, I'm afraid."
</p>

<p>
"No," Deacon declared positively.  "I counted
every card I took in.  That's the one thing I was
correct on.  I've twenty-six, and you've twenty-six."
</p>

<p>
"Count again," Grief said.
</p>

<p>
Carefully and slowly, with trembling fingers,
Deacon counted the cards he had taken.  There
were twenty-five.  He reached over to the corner of
the table, took up the rules Grief had written, folded
them, and put them in his pocket.  Then he emptied
his glass, and stood up.  Captain Donovan looked at
his watch, yawned, and also arose.
</p>

<p>
"Going aboard, Captain?" Deacon asked.
</p>

<p>
"Yes," was the answer.  "What time shall I send
the whaleboat for you?"
</p>

<p>
"I'll go with you now.  We'll pick up my luggage
from the <i>Billy</i> as we go by.  I was sailing on her for
Babo in the morning."
</p>

<p>
Deacon shook hands all around, after receiving a
final pledge of good luck on Karo-Karo.
</p>

<p>
"Does Tom Butler play cards?" he asked Grief.
</p>

<p>
"Solitaire," was the answer.
</p>

<p>
"Then I'll teach him double solitaire."  Deacon
turned toward the door, where Captain Donovan
waited, and added with a sigh, "And I fancy he'll
skin me, too, if he plays like the rest of you island
men."

<p>
It was in the autumn of 1904 that the Colonel
told the story; Colonel M&mdash;&mdash;, who, with his
seventy years, his snowy hair and imperial,
was yet as ruddy of cheek and as gallant of bearing
as when in the old days he led the &mdash;th Cavalry
through the deserts of the West.  Since his
retirement his home was at the Army and Navy Club,
where his charming little dinners and his unfailing
wit and eloquence as an after-dinner speaker made
this courtly old warrior the most sought for man
about the capital.
</p>

<p>
We had dined with the Colonel that evening, and
as we entered the club smoking-rooms we overheard
fragments of an animated conversation between two
naval officers, who were debating the probable
movements of the United States battleship squadron
in case the feud between Japan and Russia should
involve other nations.  The relative strength of the
Japanese and Russian navies, both as to material
and personnel, was also under discussion.  In
support of some claim as to Japanese superiority, one of
the navy men took up an encyclopedia, from which
he read the following:
</p>

<p>
"'<i>Samurai</i>&mdash;A term designating the feudal or
governing class of old Japan; the ruling families from
which the fighting clans were organised; a fighting
man.'"
</p>

<p>
We found seats in the farther corner of the room
and, after a few moments of silence, the Colonel
remarked, in the musing tone which always promised
a story:
</p>

<p>
"Boys, I once knew a Samurai; two of them, in
fact; one to the manner born, the other a Samurai
by adoption."
</p>

<p>
"Unlimber and get your range, Colonel, we are
ready," remarked Sanderson of the Artillery, who
would talk shop.
</p>

<p>
The old man smiled indulgently, and settling
himself deeper into the big leather chair, replied:
</p>

<p>
"Well, then, if you youngsters really care to
listen, and will allow an old fellow to tell his tale in
his own fashion, you shall hear of the Samurai I
have mentioned, two of the bravest men I ever met,
and I have known several.
</p>

<p>
"At the close of the rebellion, after being mustered
out as captain in the Tenth New York Cavalry, I
re-entered the service as a lieutenant in the Fourth
Regulars, and was at once ordered to Fort Sill.
This was in '65, and for the next fifteen years we
earned every dollar Uncle Sam paid us, and
incidentally rode our horses over some millions of square
miles of his territory, between the Brazos and the
Big Horn.  It was scout and fight, winter and
summer; no big affairs, you understand, but a row
of some sort going all the while, for the Indians were
ugly and required lots of licking to keep them on
their reservations.  April 5, 1880, I was transferred
to the &mdash;th Cavalry, and, as ranking captain,
assumed command of Fort Huachuca, Arizona, a
three-company post only a few miles from the
Sonora border.
</p>

<p>
"It was a favourite pastime of the redskins, for
small parties of a dozen or twenty, to break from
the reservation at night and, after raising sundry
and divers varieties of hell, to slip across the
border and take refuge in Mexico, sneaking back
to their tepees after the flurry of pursuit was over.
</p>

<p>
"It was the first day after I assumed command
that I took my own troop out on the parade-ground,
put them through their paces, and gave them a
thorough looking-over, to see what sort of an
aggregation I had inherited.  They were a rollicking lot
of lads, not pretty to look at, but comfortable
fellows to have at one's back when going into a
scrimmage, as I learned upon more than one bitter
day in the months that followed.  After a few
evolutions I felt, rather than saw, what they needed:
they wanted a master; wanted a leader whose word
should be to them the law and the gospel, from
Proverbs to Revelations, and by Gad, sir, they
found their man right there and then.  Half of
them didn't seem to know how to obey a command,
and the other half didn't appear to be in any particular
hurry.  My subalterns, too, were apathetic, and
inside of ten minutes I knew that my work was cut
out for me, if I expected to make anything of Troop C.
</p>

<p>
"The only man in the company who seemed to
know the game, and wanted to play it by the book,
was the First Sergeant.  I spotted him at once, and
noticed that he not only understood and instantly
obeyed a command, but that he mentally anticipated
it, which showed me that he was letter-perfect
in tactics.
</p>

<p>
"I didn't waste a great deal of time in letting
them know the lay of the land.  As they wheeled
into line by fours, the order was 'Halt, Company
front!' and then, riding very slowly, I passed down
the line, and over the head of his motionless horse
I looked squarely through each trooper's eyes and
down into the subcellar of his immortal soul.  At
the end of that slow riding I knew my men, and
they knew that I knew them.
</p>

<p>
"From that moment began the upbuilding of
Company C, and before six pay-days had passed it
was the best drilled, best natured, hardest fighting
troop that ever swung the sabre or followed the
guidon.
</p>

<p>
"As the Company broke ranks I could see that
the men were speaking eagerly among themselves,
evidently discussing their new 'Old Man.'  I had
my eye on that First Sergeant, and after stables
that evening I sent an orderly for him.  A few
minutes later he strode up to the open door of my
quarters, saluted and stood at attention, waiting
while I looked him over from end to end.  He was a
soldierly-looking chap, square-shouldered, well set
up, long of limb and slender, and looked as hard as
iron.  But it was at his face that I looked longest.
It was not a happy face&mdash;some great sorrow or
great disappointment had left its shadow there&mdash;but
it had character written all over.  Prominent
cheek-bones, a good nose and chin, with deep-set
gray eyes, that looked at a man, not past him.  For
a full minute he stood quietly returning my gaze,
with never a flinch nor the tremor of an eyelid.
</p>

<p>
"'What's your name, Sergeant?'
</p>

<p>
"'Reynolds, sir.'
</p>

<p>
"'How long have you been in the service?'
</p>

<p>
"'Nearly three years, sir.'
</p>

<p>
"'Step inside, Sergeant, I want to have a talk
with you.'
</p>

<p>
"As he passed the threshold he removed his hat,
and right there his Captain came very nearly
committing an unpardonable breach of discipline, for the
impulse came over me to get out of my chair and
offer the gentleman a seat.  For Sergeant Reynolds
was a gentleman, as one could see the instant his
hat came off and that magnificent forehead appeared
in evidence.  His was a splendid head, and
every line of his face and brow bore the unmistakable
stamp of intellectual force and honesty of purpose.
Why was such a man as this serving as a private
soldier in the regular army?  I was distinctly
rattled for a minute, and in the little silence which
ensued I found myself speculating as to what queer
turn of Fate's fickle wheel had brought him there.
Such cases were not infrequent, and many an
interesting identity lay concealed under Uncle
Sam's army blue.
</p>

<p>
"Whatever had been his past, I felt sure he was
the one man in the company who could be of most
assistance in bringing the troop up to concert pitch,
so I went straight to the point:
</p>

<p>
"'Sergeant, Troop C requires some good, hard
drill and better discipline.  The men need a little
ginger and soldierly spirit infused into them, and a
man in the ranks, who has his heart in the work,
can prove himself of invaluable assistance to his
officers in bringing about the desired conditions.
I had an eye on you this afternoon and, if I am not
mistaken, you know your business.  Your Captain
is going to depend on you to help him round the
troop into shape, and, willingly or unwillingly,
you're going to give him that help.  I sent for you
to tell you this and to know whether you will do it
because you want to, or because you have to.'
</p>

<p>
"Quick as a shot came his reply, 'Both, sir.'
</p>

<p>
"There was a faint smile on his lip and a pleased
look in his eyes which told me that my First Sergeant
was mine.  I dismissed him without further questioning,
for I felt intuitively that no casual inquiry
would secure Sergeant Reynolds' real history, much
as I wanted it.  A few minutes' private and pointed
conversation with each of my lieutenants that
evening, and I was ready for the siege of drill which
began the following day.  Lord!  How I did work
those fellows for the next week or two!  The men
grumbled and kicked, as is the soldier's prerogative,
but they worked.  Hennessy, the biggest, brawniest
trooper of the lot, probably voiced the general
sentiment when one hot afternoon he unburdened
himself to Reynolds.
</p>

<p>
"'What do yez make av it, Sargint?  Is this a
rest cure that the dear Captin is thryin' on us?
Bedad, I'd rayther be diggin' post holes in the stony
corner of hell than workin' as a hoss sojer unther
that man!  Sure, me liver is jolted loose and the
seat of me panties is wored out entoirely with this
ridin' and chargin' up and down the landscape from
mornin' till night.  I've dhrilled and dhrilled till the
damn thing has gone to me head, and I find meself
dhrillin' in me slape.  There's wan good thing
about it, thank Hivin, the ould divil is takin' his
own medicine, for he's dhrillin' wid us.'
</p>

<p>
"And so it was.  I took my share of the drudgery,
but it paid, for the troop began immediately to show
improvement.  Reynolds' influence in the ranks
was soon apparent, the men showing more and more
interest as the days went by.
</p>

<p>
"One evening an ambulance from Benson brought
in the long delayed mails, and as the leathern pouches
were tumbled out the men gathered about, eager
for news from the San Carlos Agency, where a break
was rumoured.  On the seat beside the driver sat a
young man in civilian dress, unmistakably a foreigner.
</p>

<p>
"'Who's your friend, Bill?' sang out one of the
crowd.
</p>

<p>
"'Recruity,' answered the driver, with a grin; 'a
gent from Japan who is stuck on sojerin' and has
come out here to get some.'
</p>

<p>
"A delighted yell came from the boys, as they
closed in and began reaching for the newcomer.
</p>

<p>
"'If the lady wud put her fut in me hand, I'd be
proud to assist her to land in Huachuca,' said
Hennessy, as he grabbed the stranger by the coat collar.
</p>

<p>
"The little fellow laughed at the reception, and
without an instant's hesitation stepped into
Hennessy's hand, then to his shoulder, and, springing
lightly over the surprised trooper's head, landed
safely on his feet.  It was neatly done, and his
evident good nature caught the crowd.
</p>

<p>
"'Bully for the Mikado!'  'Hooray for the Jap!'
chorused the men, as Hennessy, nowise abashed,
took the newcomer by the arm and moved off toward
the quarters.  Several others, scenting a lark,
hurried forward to take a hand, but Hennessy waved
them off.  'Lave go,' he said, 'I saw it first.'
</p>

<p>
"I beckoned the driver to me and inquired
concerning the stranger.
</p>

<p>
"'Don't know nuthin' about him, sir, 'cept he
tackled me as I was leaving Benson, and finally
made me understand he wanted to come here;
offered me a five-dollar gold piece to let him ride, and
here he is.  Says he wants to learn to be a 'Merican
sojer, but he don't savvy United States, not a little
bit.'
</p>

<p>
"I turned to Reynolds, who stood near, telling
him to give the Japanese something to eat and then
bring him to my quarters.  It would never do to
leave him with that lot of unredeemed pagans who
had him in tow, as they would haze him mercilessly.
I mentally decided that he would be sent
back to Benson by the ambulance returning next
morning.
</p>

<p>
"An hour later I saw Reynolds and the Jap coming
up the company street, the little fellow trotting along
beside the tall trooper, talking excitedly and smiling
as if thoroughly delighted with the situation.  As
they reached my veranda, Reynolds saluted and
said, 'Here he is, sir.'
</p>

<p>
"'Who is he, and why is he here?' I asked.
</p>

<p>
"'Izo Yamato, sir; been in America only a few
weeks, and came from San Francisco here to enlist.
Says he wants to be a cavalryman.  He is twenty-three
years old and belongs to a distinguished
family.'
</p>

<p>
"'How comes it that he has been able to tell you
so much?  I understand from the driver that he
speaks little or no English.'
</p>

<p>
"'He speaks very little English, sir; his conversation
with me was in his own language.'
</p>

<p>
"'In Japanese?  Where in God's name did you
learn Japanese?'
</p>

<p>
"'I lived in Kobe for several years, sir.'
</p>

<p>
"'Um! well, you understand, of course, that he
cannot enlist here.  He must first go to some recruiting
station and pass an examination, which he couldn't
do, both on account of his size and his lack of
English.  Take care of him to-night, Reynolds, and
we will send him back to Benson to-morrow.'
</p>

<p>
"All this time the Jap had not once taken his eyes
from my face, eagerly watching every movement and
gesture I made.  Suddenly, as he seemed to understand
that I had refused his request, he stepped before
me, and drawing himself up to his full height,
he declared proudly, 'Me Samurai.'
</p>

<p>
"I looked at Reynolds for an explanation.
</p>

<p>
"'He says he is a Samurai, sir, which, translated
into English, means that he is a fighting man.'
</p>

<p>
"I laughed outright, while the smile on the little
Jap's face broadened perceptibly, as he spoke a half
dozen quick, snappy sentences in Japanese to Reynolds.
</p>

<p>
"'He says he doesn't expect to draw pay, sir; he
has ample funds, and only wants to learn American
soldiering.'
</p>

<p>
"I couldn't do anything for him in that line, and
told Reynolds so.  A quick shadow of disappointment
passed over the youngster's face, as Reynolds
translated my words, and I really felt sorry for him.
He was a handsome little chap, about five feet four,
deep-chested, stocky, and muscular, a sort of a big
little man, when one came to look him over.  He had
jet-black hair, laughing eyes, and, while his features
were of course after the Oriental type, he really
looked more like a Portuguese or some south Europe
breed than a Japanese.  After some further talk I
dismissed them, fully determined to send him out of
camp the following morning&mdash;but he didn't go.
</p>

<p>
"Just before taps Reynolds came to me again to
ask that his new friend be permitted to remain at the
post for a time, explaining that the Jap would furnish
his own equipment, and that the government would
be reimbursed for the rations he consumed.  He
urged the case so strongly that I finally inquired
what personal interest he had in the matter.  At
first he seemed loath to explain, but it finally came
out.
</p>

<p>
"'Frankly, sir, I want his society.  I haven't a
real friend in the troop; of course, I get on well
enough with the boys, but they are an illiterate lot,
and it's fearfully lonely here at times, having no one
to talk with.  Young Yamato is an educated gentleman,
and it would afford me infinite pleasure to have
him with me, to teach him and to have him as my
friend.'
</p>

<p>
"'But the men will devil the life out of him, and
you will have a constant fight on your hands if you
propose to protect your friend.'
</p>

<p>
"'I don't think they will trouble him much, as
they come to know him better, sir, and he will require
no protection.'
</p>

<p>
"'Why, Reynolds, that big Hennessy has already
marked him as his victim.  He will surely haze the
life out of the little cuss.'
</p>

<p>
"'That's Yamato's affair, sir.  I trust you will
permit him to remain at the post; if he can't stand
the gaff, then he will leave.'
</p>

<p>
"'Reynolds, I want to ask you some questions
altogether foreign to the subject in hand; questions
you needn't answer unless you see fit.  You are a
man of education and refinement; you know more
about matters military than a man in your station
is supposed to know; you are more familiar than
your officers with the latest text-books on tactics.
Were you ever at the Point?  How came you to be a
private in the service?  What is your history, anyway?'
</p>

<p>
"It was brutal, the manner in which I fired those
questions at him, taking a mean advantage of his
position as petitioner to pry into his private life.  I
was ashamed of it as I put the questions; I was
more ashamed when his answer came.
</p>

<p>
"Quickly the colour rose to his cheek, then gradually
receded, leaving him deadly pale, as he slowly
replied.
</p>

<p>
"'Captain, the rehearsal of a most unfortunate
and unhappy history could not in any manner be of
interest or profit to you.  I have never been at West
Point, and my training has been more naval than
military.  I am here because it appears to be the
best place for me, and while here I have tried to
perform my duties faithfully.  That's all I care to say,
sir, and I trust you will respect my reticence.'  The
grey eyes were looking fearlessly into mine.
</p>

<p>
"It was a merited rebuke, delivered like a gentleman.
</p>

<p>
"'Right, Sergeant, your history is your own
property.  You may keep the Jap, and if you need
a friend, come to me.'
</p>

<p>
"There was a suspicious brightness in his eyes and
the faintest tremor in his voice as he wrung my
proffered hand, saying, 'Thank you, Captain, I'll
not forget this.'
</p>

<p>
"So Yamato remained at the post, the ward and
pupil of Sergeant Reynolds.  The men attempted
some horse-play with him the first day or two, but
as Reynolds let it be known that the Jap was his
friend, no one cared to carry the fun-making beyond
prudent limits.  They were very curious, however,
and asked the Sergeant all sorts of questions
concerning his protégé, to which they received evasive
but good-natured replies.  Big Hennessy finally
cornered the Jap, and proceeded to catechise him.
</p>

<p>
"'How ould are yez, Chink?'
</p>

<p>
"'Me have of the years twenty-three,' replied the
lad, with his everlasting smile.
</p>

<p>
"'Twinty-three!  Sure, 'tis a big boy ye are gettin'
to be; if yez kape on growin' at the prisint rate, yez
will be a full-grown man in thirty or forty years
more,' and the Irishman guffawed uproariously.
</p>

<p>
"'Well, me big man, what did yez do for a livin'
in the ould counthry?  Did yez wheel the baby
waggin and do other light dhry-nursin', or was ye
head push in a laundhry?'
</p>

<p>
"Not understanding, the Jap shook his head.
</p>

<p>
"Hennessy tried again.
</p>

<p>
"'What business were yez in?  What did ye work at?'
</p>

<p>
"Extending himself to his full height, with great
dignity the Japanese replied:
</p>

<p>
"'Me no work; in my countree me gentleman;
me Samurai.'
</p>

<p>
"'Samoory, eh?  What particular sort av a bug
is a Samoory, anyhow?'
</p>

<p>
"'Him no bug; Samurai ees one man of the fight.'
</p>

<p>
"'Whoop!' yelled the big trooper derisively; then
raising his voice till he could be heard from end to
end of the company street, he shouted,
</p>

<p>
"'Oyez!  Oyez! all ye fighters come a-runnin'
with yure hats in yure hands, and do riverince to a
rale live Samoory from the Far East.'
</p>

<p>
"Then as the boys quickly gathered about, he
made a profound obeisance before the surprised
Jap, and resumed.
</p>

<p>
"'Gintlemen, dhrunkards, short-card min, and
sojers!  'Tis me pleasure to inthrojuce to yez me
distinguished frind and contimporary, Mister
Samoory, av Japan, who has confidentially imparted
to me the information that in his own counthry he
was known as a fighter from way back, a hell of a
feller, so to spake; and be rayson of his ability as an
all-roun' scrapper, the King gave him the title of
"Sammy, the Fightin' Man."  All mimbers of
Troop C will now take warnin'!  Yez will plaze
kape off the grass when Mister Sammy is awake.
Hospital accommodations will be provided for them
as forgit themselves.  Form in line now, ye divils,
and extind the right hand of fellowship to Mister
Sammy, who has thravelled all the way to Americky
to be showin' us the fine points av the game.'
</p>

<p>
"The Jap looked puzzled, but as those overgrown
children lined up, each in turn extending his hand,
the smile broadened and the black eyes fairly beamed
with pleasure.  This ceremony ended, the boys gave
three rousing cheers for 'Sammy, the Fighting
Man,' the fun was over, and henceforth he was
'Sammy' to one and all.
</p>

<p>
"When Reynolds returned later in the day,
Sammy delightedly told him of Hennessy's kindness
and the great honour conferred upon him by Troop
C.  Reynolds did not disillusion the boy, but, later
on, quietly told the men that while they might guy
the Jap and have fun with him, it would not be wise
to carry it too far.  They assumed by this warning
that Reynolds would resent any undue imposition
upon his friend; not once did it occur to them that
Sammy was amply able to care for himself.  Their
enlightenment was yet to come.
</p>

<p>
"Sammy's fitting out and equipment furnished
no end of fun for the men.  He wanted everything
necessary to a ''Merican Soldier of the Horse,' and,
as he was amply supplied with gold, he soon had his
tent, blankets, and weapons.  From some unknown
source the boys dug out an old, rusty cavalry sabre,
which he hailed with evident delight and which he at
once proceeded to scour and polish till it shone like
silver.  Then he ground and whetted and sharpened
the old blade till it was keen as a razor.  In vain the
men explained that the laws of war prohibited a
sharpened sword.  'Me want him for cut,' was his
only reply, as he went on whetting till the old steel
would have split a hair.  Then he took his sabre to
the blacksmith and requested that he file off the
basket, or hand-guard, leaving a plain, straight,
unprotected hilt.  'Me like him better; same like in
my countree,' he explained.
</p>

<p>
"It was in securing a horse that he had greatest
difficulty.  Not being an enlisted man, he could not
be permitted to use a government mount, nor could
he purchase a horse from Uncle Sam.  After a private
conversation with Mexican Joe, the proprietor
of one of the low groggeries just outside the lines,
Mr. Hennessy announced that he had heard of a fine
saddle horse for sale by a Greaser a few miles down
the valley, and, if his friend Sammy so desired, the
horse should be brought up to cantonments on the
morrow.  Next day a Mexican led a piebald,
white-eyed broncho into camp, and within five minutes
departed hurriedly with fifty dollars of Sammy's
gold in his pocket.  It was a bay and white pinto
which Sammy had acquired; round-bodied, long-barreled,
with flat, muscular legs and a depth of
lung space indicating great staying power, but with a
Roman nose and the restless white eyes which told
unmistakably of a 'spoiled' saddle horse.  Evil
lurked in every movement of the slender, pointed
ears, and looked boldly out through those wicked
eyes.  He was one of those untamed and unbreakable
specimens of horseflesh occasionally found in
the great West.
</p>

<p>
"'Come, min,' said Hennessy briskly, 'lay hold
and help the gintleman to mount his new calico
horse,' and taking the rawhide lariat in his hand, he
advanced toward the pinto's head to adjust the
bridle; then leaping suddenly back, as the brute's
teeth snapped together dangerously near his arm,
he swung overhead the bridle with its heavy bit,
landing it with considerable force between the
white eyes.
</p>

<p>
"'Whoa! ye murdherin' divil, have ye no sinse of
dacincy?  'Tis yure new masther, the fightin' man
av Japan, who is to ride yez!'
</p>

<p>
"A dozen willing hands assisted in getting the
bridle and saddle in place; then Sammy, who
probably had not been astride a horse a dozen times in
his life, stepped forward and clambered into the
saddle.
</p>

<p>
"'All set!' shouted Hennessy, as Sammy took up
the reins; 'lave go! the Arizony circus will now
begin!'
</p>

<p>
"Begin it did; for no sooner was the maddened
brute released than he lunged wildly into the air,
alighting with a sickening jolt upon his forefeet,
while his hinder part shot skyward.  Sammy's hat
flew in one direction and his six-shooter in another,
as he clutched frantically at the saddle and
endeavoured to recover the stirrups which were sailing
about his ears.  First to the right, then to the left
pitched the horse, the men yelling in sheer delight,
'Stick to him, Sammy!' 'Go it, Calico!' etc.  It
lasted less than ten seconds, during which time
Sammy was all over that pinto horse, travelling
from end to end with each sudden unseating; first
behind the saddle, then in front of it; clinging
desperately first to one side and then the other, as
Calico swayed to and fro, like a drunken ship, in
the effort to discharge his shifting ballast.  The
rider had lost the reins, and the horse, without
guide or hindrance, his head far down between his
forefeet, his back bowed into a squirming knot of
muscle, landed with a particularly vicious jolt that
shot Sammy into the air, where he somersaulted to a
landing in a bunch of bristly soapweed, the breath
completely jarred out of him.
</p>

<p>
"For a half-minute he lay still, and then as the
laughing soldiers gathered about, he slowly
straightened up and started toward the pinto, who stood
with ears perked forward, suspiciously eyeing his
fallen rider.  The boy was badly shaken; a thin
line of blood from his nose showed red on his white
lips, as he unsteadily grasped the rope and warily
edged his way to the horse's head.  Once within
reach his right hand clamped the panting nostrils,
while his left gripped an ear; there was a quick,
downward pull, an inward push, a sudden upward
twist, and Calico lay floundering on the ground
with Sammy sitting on his head.
</p>

<p>
"So quickly was it accomplished not a man of
them could have told how it had been done.  Sammy
was smiling again, as he sat quietly till the beast
ceased its struggles; then, getting up, he allowed
Calico to scramble to his feet.  The white eyes were
blazing now and the horse swung his head and
squealed angrily as the Jap moved in.  Again that
iron grip upon nose and ear, the sudden pushing
twist, and once more the horse fell heavily, his hoofs
impotently threshing the air.
</p>

<p>
"Twice more the pinto was permitted to rise,
and twice more he was ruthlessly thrown, the last
time that awful grip holding to his nose till poor
Calico was well-nigh dead for want of breath.
When Sammy arose the fourth time the horse lay
still, and it required a vigorous kick to bring him to
his feet, his legs trembling unsteadily beneath him,
and for the first time in his life those white eyes
showed abject fear.  Sammy walked straight to his
head, patted the dusty neck, put the reins over, then
deliberately and awkwardly climbed into the saddle
and rode slowly down the street.  Calico was
licked!  Licked to a finish!  You should have
heard the boys cheer the little Jap as he rode back a
few minutes later.
</p>

<p>
"Reynolds had seen it all yet no word escaped
him till after the horse had been stabled; then he
patted Sammy on the shoulder and spoke a few
words in Japanese, which caused the boy's face to
light up with satisfaction and his hand to seek
Reynolds' with a quick grip.
</p>

<p>
"The two were inseparable; and under Reynolds'
careful tutoring Sammy made rapid progress
in English, though some words he never did get
straight.  He learned to ride, too.  When the men
were at drill he watched every evolution, listened
to every order.  He begged so hard, and seemed so
anxious to learn, that I finally allowed him in the
ranks, a soldier serving without hope of pay or
preferment, but as gallant a soldier as ever drew
rein, as you shall hear later on.
</p>

<p>
"He got on famously with the men.  Of course,
they guyed and chaffed him, all of which he accepted
good-naturedly, so long as they kept hands off.  He
would permit no one to hustle him or indulge in any
horse-play.  One of the men attempted to
manhandle him one day, when Sammy grappled with
the fellow and threw him over his shoulder so
violently as nearly to break the man's neck.  After
that they respected his edict of 'hands off.'  His
thirst for knowledge seemed insatiable.  Like a
shadow he followed Reynolds; ever his eager questions,
sometimes in English, more often in Japanese,
as to why or how, receiving the tall trooper's reply in
kind.  It was about three weeks after his arrival
that Sammy had his first trouble, which came about
in this wise.
</p>

<p>
"Hennessy, who was a roistering, good-natured
fellow when sober, but a quarrelsome brute when
in his cups, had spent the afternoon at Mexican
Joe's dive, and returning to camp in the evening,
was fighting drunk and hankering for trouble.
</p>

<p>
"It so happened that the tent occupied by Sammy
stood at one end of the adobe building in which
Hennessy bunked, and the latter, to reach his door,
must pass within a few feet of the little Jap, who
sat cross-legged on the ground at the open flap of
his tent, tinkering at his equipment.  Some evil
spirit prompted the drunken Irishman to bait the
Japanese, for he stopped, and with an ugly leer
commanded the boy to get up and get him a cup, as
he proposed to initiate all stray Orientals about the
camp into the mysteries of American tanglefoot.
</p>

<p>
"'Get up, ye sawed-off haythen, and bring me
the cup, before I spit and dhrown yez.'
</p>

<p>
"Sammy smiled and went on fixing his buckle.
</p>

<p>
"'Didn'tyez hear me, ye naygur?  I've a mind
to take on a body sarvint in me ould age, and as
yure so dam purty and so smilin'-like, yez have
been elected by a most overwhelmin' majority as
striker to the Honorable Tim Hinnissy, and I'll
start yez in proper by fillin' yez up on this,' and
he swung the bottle dangerously near Sammy's head.
</p>

<p>
"Still smiling, Sammy shook his head.  'No
want him, those drink; him make for me pain of the
head.'
</p>

<p>
"Hennessy scowled angrily.
</p>

<p>
"'Don't want it, don't yez?  Well, 'tis time ye
were larnin' that whin yure boss gives ye an ordther
ye are to move, and not sit squattin' like a
cross-legged toad, argifying.  Git up, now, or I'll kick a
hole through the basement of yure pants!' and he
touched the lad none too gently with the toe of his
boot.
</p>

<p>
"Sammy looked surprised, but still shook his
head and smiled.
</p>

<p>
"'No want him, those drink; no geet up.'
</p>

<p>
"Hennessy's big foot swung back, then forward,
as he landed a vicious kick squarely amidships;
Sammy rolled over, without doubt the most
surprised and the maddest Japanese in the Western
Hemisphere.  He sprang to his feet, his eyes ablaze,
but as Hennessy raised his foot for another kick,
Sammy ducked under the tent flap and disappeared
within.
</p>

<p>
"Hennessy howled derisively and stepped forward
with the evident intention of following, but
just then his head rocked backward from an awful
smash dealt him by the youngster, who stepped
out of the tent and faced the furious Irishman.  It
was the hilt of that old cavalry sabre which had
halted Mr. Hennessy's advance.  Full and square
in his teeth the blow had landed, and as he spat
the blood and a couple of floating teeth from between
his lacerated lips, he yelled, 'Ye son of a scutt!  ye
wud play wid the tools, wud yez?'  He sprang into
the open door of his own quarters, snatched up his
sabre, and, leaping out, sent the scabbard clattering
to the earth as he strode toward the waiting Jap,
who seemed to have forgotten his anger and was
now smiling expectantly.
</p>

<p>
"The blow had instantly sobered the big trooper,
but it had also wakened the devil in him, and it
was evident to the men who ran flocking to the
scene that Hennessy meant to hurt the boy, possibly
to kill him.
</p>

<p>
"'Now, ye haythen toad, I'll show yez how to use
the business end av a cheese knife!  I'll just slice
off wan ear as a sooveneer an' then I'll spank yez
with the flat av me blade; but if ye are nasty about it,
by God, I'll take the two av thim,' and with this he
made a vicious cut at Sammy's head, the blow
slipping harmlessly from the waiting steel.
</p>

<p>
"Two of the men started to rush Hennessy from
the rear to prevent a killing, but Reynolds interfered,
saying, 'Let him alone; this isn't your fight.'
</p>

<p>
"'But Hennessy's crazy drunk and will kill him!'
</p>

<p>
"'I don't think so,' calmly replied Reynolds.
'Hennessy will presently see a great light, and, if
I mistake not, will be a very sober man when he
finishes his job.'
</p>

<p>
"And it was so.  For the first few moments
Sammy seemed content to parry the strokes which
were rained upon him with all the strength and
fury of the enraged Irishman.  So furiously did
Hennessy press home his attack, and so steadfastly
did the little Jap hold his ground, that again and
again the blades were engaged up to the very hilt,
and it seemed that Sammy's unguarded sword-hand
must surely suffer; but each time a deft turn
of the wrist put aside the danger.  The boy's
enigmatical smile, and the ease with which he parried
each savage cut and thrust, seemed to drive the
big trooper wild, for with a fierce oath he redoubled
his effort and sought by sheer weight to break down
his adversary's guard.
</p>

<p>
"Then Sammy's tactics changed, and within
ten seconds the spellbound men realised, as did
Hennessy, that with all his bulk and strength the
big fellow was but as a child, absolutely at the
mercy of that smiling, youthful foe, while the
sword-play which followed was the talk of many a
campfire in the years that followed.
</p>

<p>
"Stepping back a pace, the Japanese suddenly set
his sabre whirling in a peculiar wheel-like movement,
which opposed a circular shield of steel to Hennessy's
weapon.  Swifter and swifter whirled that shining
thing, its sibilant hiss growing more and more
venomous, menacing, and deadly.  Utterly confounded,
Hennessy paused, his sword-arm extended, too
dumbfounded to give ground or to drop his point.
Suddenly the guardless sabre shot out, and, engaging
the Irishman's blade, tore it from his hand and
sent it flying over the heads of the crowd, to fall
harmlessly fifty feet away.  Then, as his arms
dropped limply, the grey of a great fear stole over
Hennessy's face, not the fear of a coward, but the
fear of a brave man who looks into the eyes of a
death he cannot parry,&mdash;while that silent serpent of
steel darted through his hair, between ear and skull,
first on one side, then the other; passed like lightning
within a hairbreadth of his jugular; then under
each armpit, or flicked a button from the bosom of
his shirt, as if seeking the most deadly spot to place
its fatal sting.  Yet no harm came to the Irishman;
not one drop of blood did he lose.
</p>

<p>
"In a minute it was ended.  Sammy swung his
sabre upward and brought it down flat-side, landing
with a sounding whack just above Hennessy's left
ear, knocking all the sense out of him for five
minutes.  Turning to Reynolds, the boy laughingly said,
'Me no hurt him; him no Samurai; him big boy,
not know how for make those fight.'  Then he sat
down before his tent and resumed the repairs on his
buckle.
</p>

<p>
"That settled it.  Sammy had made good as a
fighting man, and from that day he was the idol of
the Company.  Hennessy was thoroughly whipped,
and, like a real man, he knew it and bore no malice.
After an hour he emerged from his quarters, and
walking up to the Jap, grasped his hand.
</p>

<p>
"'Sammy, yure the boss.  God knows ye should
av kilt me for the dhirty cur that I was, but ye didn't,
and I'm yure frind.  If yez want a striker to clane
yure horse, or to be doin' yure maynial wurruk, it's
meself that's lookin' for the job, for ye are the biggest
man I iver hooked up wid, if ye are put up in a small
bundle.'
</p>

<p>
"Sammy's smile broadened, as he warmly shook
the Irishman's hand.
</p>

<p>
"'Hennessy one fine boy, when he no make of
those drink; it is good for be friends.'
</p>

<p>
"Hennessy spent ten days in the guardhouse for
his drunken folly, and it was Sammy who regularly
carried to him tidbits from his own mess.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
"We had enjoyed a season of comparative quiet,
but the long expected break came early in July.
The entire Apache nation, which had for months
been seething with unrest, now broke into open
revolt with the usual campaign of murder and
pillage.
</p>

<p>
"At dusk one evening a courier, who had ridden
seventy miles since noon, brought orders from the
Colonel to intercept a war party of seventy or eighty
Tontos, who were reported raiding up the San
Simeon Valley, bound for Sonora.  Company F, at
Fort Bowie, would cut them off from the outlet at
the upper end of the valley, when it was supposed
the reds would swing to the westward and, skirting
the hills, would cross the Divide at or near Dragoon
Summit and make for the Mexican border through
the foothills to the west of Dos Cabesos.  By hard
riding it might be possible to intercept them at
Hanging Rock Springs, a favourite camping-place
for such expeditions.
</p>

<p>
"Hurried preparations were made, and at three
o'clock next morning Troop C filed out from
cantonments on its long ride.  As men and horses were
fresh, we rapidly put mile after mile behind us in the
cool morning hours.  A hurried breakfast as the sun
came up from behind the distant Dragoons, and then
began the dreary ride across the desolate stretch of
hill and plain which lay between us and Hanging
Rock, the point at which I hoped to bag our game.
Mile after mile we jogged under the blazing Arizona
sun, the rear of the little column hidden in the
blinding alkali dust, which rose in clouds from the dry,
parched earth.  Far to the front, with the flankers,
rode Reynolds, and with him Sammy, who had
entered upon this man-hunt with all the enthusiasm
of a boy.
</p>

<p>
"At noon we halted for an hour, to rest the horses
and eat our slender ration; then on we pushed across
the barren wastes toward our destination.  At
mid-afternoon the heat became terrific, the horses
suffering severely and many of them beginning to show
evidences of the twelve-hours' stretch.  Hanging
Rock, fifteen miles away, was now in plain view
across the valley, but it began to be questionable
whether the command could reach it before dusk, and
it would be most imprudent to scale the hill and
enter that rocky den after the sun had gone down.
</p>

<p>
"Nature, in a freakish mood, had pushed the long
shelf of rock out from the summit of the divide, and
most strange it was that there, high up above the
plain, should bubble forth from beneath the hanging
scarp of stone, a great spring of clear, cool water.
The ridge was a wilderness of giant boulders, a
jungle of ragged rocks, thick strewn, as if scattered by
some Titan hand in the far-off days when earth was
young.
</p>

<p>
"Suddenly the left flankers, a half mile in advance,
drew up, and Reynolds' signal told me that
something unusual was beyond.  A moment later we saw
a single horseman emerge from one of the numerous
blind cañons on the left and ride rapidly toward the
waiting soldiers.  Reaching them he seemed to
confer for a moment, then Reynolds wheeled and dashed
back toward the column, waving his hat and shouting
some unintelligible message.  As I rode forward
to meet the flying horseman, his white face warned
me of evil tidings.
</p>

<p>
"'Captain, a scout from Fort Grant says that
the Colonel's wife and his two little children, with
a detail of six men, left Grant at noon, to meet the
Colonel at Huachuca; two hours after they left the
post, news of the break reached the camp, and
Captain Dunlap sent this scout after the Colonel's
wife to bring her back.  He ran into a band of
Apaches who were following the trail of the
ambulance, and he thinks they will overtake it at Hanging
Rock.  Unable to warn the detail, and with another
band of Indians between him and Grant, he cut
around and was making for Huachuca when he spied
us.'
</p>

<p>
"God!  It was fifteen miles to Hanging Rock, and
even now the little detail might be surrounded.  And
a woman, too!  It meant swift action; so, turning
to the command, I told the men the situation,
explaining that the lives of our Colonel's wife and
children, and of the six troopers, depended upon our
reaching Hanging Rock before the reds could
complete their devilish work.  As many of the horses
were exhausted, it would depend upon those who
had the best mounts to make the rescue, so I ordered
each man to do his best and started the entire troop
upon a free-for-all run for the Rock.  Within ten
minutes Company C was strung out for a mile across
the desert, the better horses forging to the front, the
weaker falling to the rear.
</p>

<p>
"Fortunately, my horse was in fair condition and
carried me well to the front.  I rode hard, but far in
advance of all raced Reynolds' big bay and Sammy's
pinto.  An hour, which seemed an eternity, had
passed, when less than a score of troopers reached
the foot of the ridge a mile from the spring.  As one
after another of the horses dropped back exhausted,
I wondered how many would be with me at the
finish, and if we should be in time.
</p>

<p>
"Suddenly from the heights above came the far-away
bang of a Springfield, then another, while the
faint puff of rifle smoke floating from the summit
told us that the Tontos were at work.  Up the slope
we went as rapidly as the reeking horses would carry
us; far to the front, now disappearing behind the
rocks, rode Reynolds and Sammy.  The reports of
the Springfields came ever clearer to us as we toiled
up the rocky slope, and now and again we heard the
exultant yells of the savages as they pressed their
attack.
</p>

<p>
"A quarter of a mile from the spring my horse
wavered, then stumbled and fell, unable to carry
me another rod.  Snatching my pistols from the
holsters, I ran on, hoping against hope that we
might be in time.  A louder chorus of savage yells
and a popping of the Colts told me that Reynolds
and Sammy had reached the scene.  Breathless with
the uphill run, I finally turned a giant boulder, and
the little amphitheatre about the spring was spread
out before me.
</p>

<p>
"To the rear of the water hole stood an ambulance,
the mules all down; just behind the spring, and
cowering against the overhanging rock, was the Colonel's
wife, with her helpless little ones; while lying about
were five motionless figures in faded army blue,
which told the story of brave men who had battled
to the last and had died the soldier's death.  Beside
the praying woman knelt a wounded trooper, calmly
shooting into the horde of savage figures who were
darting and dodging amidst the rocks; while to the
left and in front stood Sammy and Reynolds, their
Colts spitting viciously at the Indians, who were
evidently surprised and disturbed by the unwelcome
re-enforcements.  The men were directly between
the Indians and the woman, and as the savages hoped
to capture the latter alive they were not using their
guns, but had attacked the Jap and his comrade
with knives and war clubs.
</p>

<p>
"As I looked, the wounded man went down, and,
casting aside their empty weapons, Reynolds and
Sammy drew their sabres and stood between the
kneeling woman and the two score of yelping beasts.
A moment later Reynolds toppled backward from
a murderous thrust in the side and a blow from a
war club upon the head, delivered simultaneously,
and Sammy was alone, confronting that swarm of
naked cut-throats.  A half-dozen of my men now
came running up the trail, and in an instant their
Springfields were roaring as they pressed forward,
shooting, and shouting encouragement to the boy.
</p>

<p>
"And then, startlingly clear and vibrant, above
the din of the yelling savages, above the shouts of
the men and the banging of the Springfields, rose
in a foreign tongue a strange, weird chant, full and
sonorous as a trumpet-call.  It was the battle song
of the Samurai,&mdash;Sammy's answering challenge&mdash;the
war-cry of his fathers.  About him shimmered
and hissed that impenetrable circle of steel, and
though they hacked and stabbed in frantic haste,
not once did a hostile thrust reach beyond that
matchless guard.  Like a thing of light, the shining
weapon darted here and there, claiming with each
touch its tithe of blood.
</p>

<p>
"The leader of the redskins, a hideously painted
buck, seeing the rescuers near at hand, made a
sudden feint and, dropping upon one knee,
attempted to stab the boy through the abdomen.  It
was his last stroke, for as Sammy sprang back his
blade whirled downward, the savage hand dropped
to the earth, lopped clean at the wrist as with an
axe, and the next instant a life went out through an
ugly gash in the dusky throat.  Louder rose that
rhythmic chant, while ever, like some thin flame,
the slender blade played swiftly about the swordsman.
</p>

<p>
"Reynolds struggled to rise, but was too badly
hurt, and sank beside the prostrate trooper.  Never
pausing in his song, Sammy stepped in front of his
fallen friend, and as the steel told on its fateful
tale, high up above the din of strife the sonorous
words rang out:
</p>

<p>
"'Heed me, oh mighty ones, my fathers of the
past!  The spirit lives within thy son!  See! the
arm is strong, the hand is sure, and with each stroke
the life wine flows!  To the sacred annals of our
house I add another deed.  Hail to ye, oh mighty
dead!  Hail! heroes of Yamato's line!'
</p>

<p>
"Swiftly and more deadly flamed that gleaming
brand, as Sammy, seemingly endowed with more
than human strength, now took the offensive and
pressing into the struggling band, made a sudden,
swinging side-cut which swept a head completely
from its moorings, then plunged a foot of steel into
another naked breast.
</p>

<p>
"It was more than the Tontos could stand, and
they gave way before the Jap's sudden onslaught,
taking refuge behind the rocks.  A dozen troopers
were now in action, their fire soon causing the
Indians to scatter like quail along the rocky ridge,
where it would have been foolhardy to pursue.
</p>

<p>
"As the Indians fled Sammy dropped his dripping
point, and turning, ran back to Reynolds, and was
in the act of lifting him when an Indian, who had
paused in his flight, rested his rifle barrel upon a
boulder, and, taking deliberate aim, shot the Jap
through the body.  The little fellow pitched
forward and lay so motionless we thought him dead;
but as the boys tenderly lifted and turned him he
smiled faintly, as he said, 'Me all right; help Meester
Reynolds.'  Then the mercy of unconsciousness
came to him, and he lay white and still as one whose
earthly cares were at an end.
</p>

<p>
"It was the wickedest little fight I've ever seen;
five troopers were dead and three were desperately
wounded, while there were eighteen good Indians to
balance the account, seven of them Sammy's.  But
the woman and her babies were safe, so the sacrifice
had not been wholly in vain.
</p>

<p>
"The surgeon shortly reached the scene and
hurriedly examined the wounded men.  To my
look of inquiry, he replied, 'Reynolds and the other
man will pull through, but Sammy is booked, spine
broken.'  From the troopers gathered close about
came a half-suppressed sob, which told, more
eloquently than words, how the lad had won them.
</p>

<p>
"Throwing out a strong picket, I made quick
preparations for the night.  Within an hour the
remainder of the command had struggled in, the
Colonel's wife and children were housed in the
ambulance, supper was cooked, then the stillness
and the grandeur of an Arizona night was upon
that blood-stained bivouac.
</p>

<p>
"Reynolds, his head bandaged and the long cut
in his side dressed and stitched, slept fitfully,
muttering incoherently of unknown people and places.
For Sammy, nothing could be done; his hurt was
mortal, and within a few hours the great Silence,
the Nirvana of his faith, would be his.  Presently
the moon came swinging up into the cloudless,
starlit sky, driving back the shadows, toning the
rough outlines of the rocks, and making beautiful
the rugged amphitheatre about the spring.  By
ten o'clock it was as light as at early dawn, while the
surgeon and I sat beside the now conscious boy as
he lay upon the rough blanket bed.
</p>

"'Sammy,' I said, as I took his hand, 'you are
badly wounded and it may be that you will not
again return to your people.  Will you tell me of
your home, and will you give me some message for
those who are dear to you?"
</p>

<p>
"There was wondrous strength in the grip he
gave my hand, and his voice was steady as, in
halting, uncertain English, he told me of his
birthplace in far-away Japan, his beautiful Japan that he
would never see again; of his father, the 'grand
man' who had sent him out into the world that he
might learn the ways of the 'Merican Soldier,' and
thus be of greater service to his country in some
day of need.  He told us of the great palace upon a
hill, which had been his home, and spoke reverently
of the little mother who waited for his return.  He
was most anxious that his father should know he
had fallen in battle, and that many men had felt
his steel before he went down.
</p>

<p>
"'Me Samurai,' he added, simply; 'it is good
that Samurai should die in those fight.'
</p>

<p>
"Reynolds, unconscious and feverishly moaning,
lay a few feet distant, and Sammy asked that he be
moved so that he might lie beside his friend.  Just
beside his bed the moonlight showed a tiny desert
flower, a flower not born to blush unseen, but
destined, thank God, to brighten the dying hour of that
home-hungry little Japanese.  He plucked the
flower, and lifting it to his lips, he said, 'Many
flowers in my countree.'  After this he lay very
still, gazing steadily up into the limitless, jewelled
space, as if trying to fathom the eternal mystery of
life and death.  It was nearly midnight when I
noticed that his hands were growing cold, and found
that the respiration was growing very laboured.
The surgeon, after feeling the pulse, beckoned me
aside to whisper that the hour was come.
</p>

<p>
"As we bent over him, his eyes sought mine and
he said, haltingly, 'Captaine and that doctor man
are been verre good to Sammy.'  Turning his
head, he noticed that the blanket had fallen away
from his comrade's shoulder; with great effort he
reached out, and pulling the blanket in place, patted
the shoulder lovingly, and laid the desert flower
upon Reynolds' breast.  'Him my friend,' he
whispered; 'him Samurai, too; him 'Merican Samurai.'  For
a few minutes his pulse fluttered intermittently,
when I saw that his lips were moving, and bending
low, I caught the faintly murmured words, 'Nippon!
Nippon!  Samurai!'  Then the brave heart was still
forever, and we knew that a gallant soul had passed.
</p>

<p>
"So died a Samurai; giving his young life in
defense of the helpless ones of an alien people, a
people who regarded him and his kind as pagans.
Surely, in the final muster, the Great Commander,
making no distinction as to race or creed, will
reward soldiers such as he.
</p>

<p>
"It was a sad returning to the home camp.
Reynolds, raving in delirium, was conveyed slowly in
the ambulance, and it was not until after poor
Sammy had been buried that he regained consciousness.
A fortnight later he emerged from the hospital,
gaunt and haggard, with deep lines on his brow
from this last sorrow, for he had loved his little
comrade with all the strength of his great nature.
</p>

<p>
"The men came in a body to request that Sammy
should be given a soldier's funeral.  The Colonel,
who had arrived, and had heard how the boy died,
cried like a child as he told the men they should
have their wish.
</p>

<p>
"At sunset we laid him to rest, with full military
honours.  The salute was fired; then, with tears
coursing down his bronzed cheek, the bugler stepped
to the head of that lowly grave and sounded taps&mdash;the
soldier's 'good-night.'  Sweetly and sadly those
mournful cadences floated out over the desert,
Troop C's farewell to little Sammy.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
"Two days later a message came from Department
Headquarters inquiring if one Izo Yamato, a
Japanese, was at Huachuca, and if so to extend to
him every courtesy, etc., etc., by order of the War
Department.  I replied, briefly detailing the history
of his death.  I also wrote the Japanese consul at
San Francisco, telling him all.
</p>

<p>
"A month slipped by, when an ambulance and
escort arrived from Benson.  Sammy's father,
Count Yamato, a distinguished man of middle age,
had come to take the body home.  Through an
interpreter and Reynolds he heard the story of
Sammy's gallant fight and death.  He was much
moved and, though his eyes were dim with unshed
tears, he gravely saluted the Colonel and myself,
and declared himself content, since his son had died
as befitted a Samurai of his rank.
</p>

<p>
"Through the interpreter, we told him of the
great friendship between his son and Reynolds.
It was after a long talk with the Count next day
that Reynolds sought the Colonel with a strange
request.  He explained that, as his three years of
service would expire within a month, he desired
the Colonel's influence with the Department in
securing his immediate discharge.  The Count had
offered formally to adopt him as his son and, having
no ties which bound him to his native land, the
Sergeant had accepted.  Count Yamato seconded
the petition, stating that having lost his only son,
his heart had gone out to the gallant young American
whom he now desired to make his heir.  It was
easily arranged, and two days later they started
west with Sammy's remains.
</p>

<p>
"Within a week or two after I, too, was in San
Francisco, ordered to duty at the Presidio.  As I
crossed the ferry from Oakland, we ran close under
the stern of a great Pacific liner bound for the
Orient.  On the after-deck stood a tall figure, and
Sergeant Reynolds' voice came to me across the
waters, 'Good-bye and God bless you, Captain.'  The
Count stood beside him, and I knew that
below decks little Sammy's body was going home
to sleep beside his fathers.  Into the splendour of
the sunset which lay beyond the Golden Gate,
to the far-off land of flowers, sailed the mighty
ship bearing my two Samurai, the living and the
dead."
</p>

<p>
The Colonel paused in his story, and taking from
his pocket a letter postmarked Tokio, Japan, May
1, 1904, he read the following extract:
</p>

<p>
"'As a military man you are, of course, interested
in the war.  Here in Japan we hear little of events
at the front save the official dispatches, with which
you are already familiar.  Yesterday, however, I
witnessed an event of more than passing interest.
During the recent desperate fighting between the
Japanese torpedo flotilla and the Russian
battleships about Port Arthur, a lieutenant-commander
of the Japanese navy, in command of a destroyer,
made a daring and successful attack upon one of
the enemy's vessels.  He was killed in the action,
and his body brought home for interment.  Never
have I seen so splendid a spectacle nor so impressive
a service.  In attendance were the Emperor and
the entire Imperial Court, as well as the highest
officers of the Army and Navy, all ablaze with gold
lace and jewelled decorations.  The body rested
upon a magnificent catafalque of purple velvet,
bearing the national arms and draped with the
battle-flags of his ship.  It seems that the officer
had been a Samurai, a member of some noble family,
and, in recognition of his gallantry in action, a part
of the ceremony was the conferring by the Emperor
on the dead man of the Order of the Golden Kite,
thus marking him as one of Japan's national heroes.
After this ceremony was ended, an old, white-haired
noble, said to be the dead man's father,
took from an attendant a package, which proved to
be a silken American flag, with which he reverently
covered the casket.  Then the crowd slowly filed
out, leaving the dead hero alone under the folds of
Old Glory.  It is said to have been an event
unprecedented in the history of Japan, but I could learn
little concerning it.  Those I asked either didn't
know, or wouldn't tell.  Strange people, these
Japanese.'"
</p>

<p>
The Colonel folded up the letter and replaced it
in his pocket.  As he rose to bid us good-night, he
said:
</p>

<p>
"I have since learned that the daring commander
who gave his life to Japan, and whose body lay in
the old temple, shrouded in the American colours,
was Sergeant Reynolds of old Troop C, one of my
Two Samurai."
